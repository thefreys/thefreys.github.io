Each search engine has its own preference for sitemap file formats. However, the most widely accepted format is **XML sitemap** ¹²³. XML sitemaps are versatile and can be used to supply additional data about images, video, and news content, as well as the localized versions of your pages ¹. They are also easily extensible and can provide the most information about your URLs ¹. 

It's important to note that the sitemap file must be **UTF-8 encoded** and hosted anywhere on your site, but unless you submit your sitemap through Search Console, a sitemap affects only descendants of the parent directory ¹. The sitemap file size is limited to 50MB (uncompressed) or 50,000 URLs. If you have a larger file or more URLs, you must break your sitemap into multiple sitemaps ¹. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
