You canâ€™t use headings, blockquotes, lists, horizontal rules, images, or most HTML tags inside table cells.

You can display a pipe (|) character in a table by using its HTML character code (&#124;).

```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
