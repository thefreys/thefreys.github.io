You can make bird food using bacon fat. One simple recipe involves mixing bacon fat with bird seeds and grains. Here's a basic approach:

1. **Collect Bacon Fat**: After cooking bacon, save the fat and let it cool to a semi-solid state.
2. **Mix with Bird Seeds**: Mix the bacon fat with bird seeds, grains, or even small pieces of dried fruit.
3. **Shape the Mixture**: You can form the mixture into balls, spread it on a pine cone, or fill it into a suet feeder.
4. **Cool or Freeze**: Allow the mixture to set by cooling it or freezing it, making it easier for the birds to eat.

Remember to place your bird food in a spot where birds frequent and ensure it's suitable for the local bird species. Also, be aware that while many birds enjoy this type of food, it's high in fat and should be offered as a supplement to their natural diet, not a replacement.
