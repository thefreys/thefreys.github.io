Tater Tot is almost 18 years old! She is a small orange female weighing in at about 6 pounds. We are trying to keep her happy and well fed despite her having hyperthyroidism and kidney disease.  

She enjoys [sleeping near any open window](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4fDSir6P4uY) when it's warm, like it is today.
