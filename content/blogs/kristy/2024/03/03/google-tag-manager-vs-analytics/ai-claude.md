Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics serve different purposes for websites:

- Google Analytics is used for website traffic analysis and measurement. It tracks information about visits to your site, your site's conversions, etc. so you can understand usage patterns and visitor behavior.

- Google Tag Manager is a tag management system that allows you to quickly and easily deploy tracking code and various marketing and analytics tags on your website or mobile app. It helps manage and configure all the different tags you might need instead of hard-coding them into all your site's pages.

Generally speaking, most websites would benefit from using both Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager together:

- Google Analytics provides the actual website analytics. You would install the Google Analytics tracking code through Google Tag Manager rather than directly on pages.

- Google Tag Manager makes it easier to set up and manage all your tags - for Google Analytics, marketing tags like Facebook Pixel and conversion tracking, remarketing tags, etc. Instead of editing code on your site, you manage tags through a web UI provided by Tag Manager.

So in summary:

- Google Analytics for the actual website data collection and analytics
- Google Tag Manager for easily and centrally deploying/managing tags like Google Analytics, marketing tags, etc. Most sites would want both. Google Tag Manager handles deploying Analytics tracking code.
