Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Google Analytics (GA) are not necessarily replacements for each other, but rather **complementary tools**. GA focuses on **collecting and analyzing website data**, while GTM acts as a **management system** for various tags, including those for GA. 

Therefore, websites wouldn't necessarily need GTM **instead** of GA, but they might benefit from using GTM **in addition** to GA in the following scenarios:

1. **Frequent code changes:** If you need to constantly make changes to tracking codes, like adding new events or pixels, GTM allows non-developers to make these edits easily within its user-friendly interface, eliminating the need to involve developers each time.

2. **Managing multiple tags:** GTM serves as a central hub for managing various tracking tags from different services, not just GA. This simplifies the process of adding, editing, and deploying tags for various marketing and analytics tools from a single platform.

3. **Complex tracking requirements:** When you need to implement more advanced tracking features like custom events, user properties, or specific firing conditions for tags, GTM offers greater flexibility and control compared to the basic implementation options available directly in GA.

In summary, while GA remains essential for website analytics, GTM offers valuable functionalities like **centralized tag management, user-friendly editing, and advanced tracking capabilities**, making it a **powerful addition** to your website's analytics toolkit, especially for scenarios involving frequent code changes, multiple tracking tools, or complex tracking needs.
