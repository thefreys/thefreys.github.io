Last year I learned all about posting to short form video platforms. This year I'm focusing on the family website and using those platforms as video storage. 

I post each video on the following short form video platforms:
* [Instagram reels](https://www.instagram.com/effariwhy/reels/)
* [Youtube shorts](https://www.youtube.com/@effariwhy/shorts)
* [Facebook reels](https://www.facebook.com/effariwhy/reels_tab)
* [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@effariwhy)

Not every platform offers an easy way to embed.  Let's see which ones are possible.  So far I only have one working and it's TikTok because my account there is public.  Instagram requires my entire account to be public in order to embed.
