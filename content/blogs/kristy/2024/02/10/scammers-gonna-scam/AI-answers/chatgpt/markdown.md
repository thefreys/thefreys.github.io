Featured Snippets are a format of search result displayed by search engines like Google, aimed at providing users with a quick and concise answer to their query right at the top of the search results page. These snippets typically appear in a box format, positioned above the regular search results, and they extract relevant information from web pages that are considered to best answer the user's question.

Featured Snippets can take various forms, including paragraphs, lists, tables, or even videos, depending on the nature of the query and the content available on the web. They are designed to offer users immediate access to the information they seek without having to click through to a specific website.

For websites, being featured in a Featured Snippet can significantly increase visibility and traffic, as their content is prominently showcased at the top of the search results page. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) strategies often target optimizing content to increase the chances of being featured in these snippets, as they can drive valuable organic traffic.
