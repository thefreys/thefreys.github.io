While a single comprehensive table encompassing all programming languages is difficult due to sheer volume, I can provide you with resources and explanations to help you understand date format strings in JavaScript and shell scripting, highlighting their differences.

**JavaScript:**

JavaScript uses the built-in `Date` object and its corresponding methods for formatting dates. The most common method is `toLocaleDateString()`, which accepts a locale string and various options for customizing the format. However, it relies on the browser's locale settings and might not be consistent across platforms.

Here are some common format specifiers used with `toLocaleDateString()` and their equivalents in other methods like `toString()`:

| JavaScript Specifier | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `%Y` | Year (4 digits) | 2024 |
| `%y` | Year (2 digits) | 24 |
| `%m` | Month (01-12) | 02 |
| `%b` | Abbreviated month | Feb |
| `%B` | Full month name | February |
| `%d` | Day of month (01-31) | 14 |
| `%A` | Full weekday name | Wednesday |
| `%a` | Abbreviated weekday name | Wed |

**Shell Scripting (Bash):**

The `date` command in Bash uses format specifiers similar to JavaScript but with some distinct features. It doesn't rely on locales and uses a fixed format syntax:

| Bash Specifier | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `%Y` | Year (4 digits) | 2024 |
| `%y` | Last two digits of the year | 24 |
| `%m` | Month (01-12) | 02 |
| `%b` | Abbreviated month | Feb |
| `%B` | Full month name | February |
| `%d` | Day of month (01-31) | 14 |
| `%A` | Full weekday name | Wednesday |
| `%a` | Abbreviated weekday name | Wed |
| `%H` | Hour (24-hour format, 00-23) | 08 |
| `%I` | Hour (12-hour format, 01-12) | 08 |
| `%M` | Minute (00-59) | 06 |
| `%S` | Second (00-59) | 15 |

**Key Differences:**

* **Locale dependence:** JavaScript methods like `toLocaleDateString()` often rely on the browser's locale, while Bash commands use a fixed format.
* **Time specifiers:** Bash offers format specifiers for hours, minutes, and seconds. JavaScript requires separate libraries or methods for formatting time beyond the date.
* **Formatting options:** JavaScript libraries like `moment.js` provide extensive formatting options, while Bash offers basic formatting through the `date` command.
