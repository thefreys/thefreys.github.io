To make t-shirt yarn, you can follow these steps:

1. Cut off the sleeves and the hem of a t-shirt that has no side seams and no printing.
2. Fold the t-shirt up, leaving an inch along the top.
3. Cut the t-shirt into strips of about an inch wide, but do not cut through the top fold.
4. Cut the strips on a diagonal to make a continuous strip of t-shirt yarn.
5. Pull the strip to make it curl on itself.
6. Join the t-shirt yarn pieces together using one of the methods shown in the links below.
