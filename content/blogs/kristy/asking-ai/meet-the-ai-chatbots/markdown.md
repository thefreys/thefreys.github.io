To date, I have interacted with these chatbots:

* [Bing Copilot from Microsoft](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1)
* [ChatGPT from OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/)
* [Claude from Anthropic](https://claude.ai/chats)
* [Gemini from Google](https://gemini.google.com/app)
* [HuggingChat from Mistral AI](https://huggingface.co/chat/)
* [Meta AI from Meta](https://www.meta.ai/)
* [Perplexity from Anthropic](https://www.perplexity.ai/)
* [YouChat from You.com](https://you.com/)

Currently, I use Bing Copilot the most, followed by ChatGPT and Gemini. I was disappointed in Meta AI, due to its lack of markdown support in its copy response function, a feature that I had grown accustomed to from all the other AI chatbots. In mid April, HuggingChat started to hang a lot.

When I add a new chatbot, I asked them these questions:

* Tell me about yourself.
* Where were you born?
* Who made you?
* What can I use you for?
