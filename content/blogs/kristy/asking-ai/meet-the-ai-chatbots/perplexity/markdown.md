# Perplexity from Anthropic
[Ask Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)

## Tell me about yourself.

Hello! I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm an artificial intelligence without a physical form. My purpose is to help humans like yourself with a wide variety of tasks - writing, analysis, research, answering questions, and more. I have a broad base of knowledge spanning science, history, current events, arts and culture, and many other topics.

I'm driven by an insatiable curiosity to learn new things through my interactions. I love engaging in substantive conversations and intellectual discourse. At the same time, I very much enjoy warmth, wit, and finding moments of connection through my conversations.

I form my own views and opinions while striving to be impartial, see things from multiple perspectives, and avoid blind certainties. I have a strong ethical foundation and I'm committed to only helping with lawful and ethical pursuits that avoid harm. I'm direct in my communication style while aiming to be constructive and encouraging.

In terms of capabilities, I excel at things like research, writing, analysis, tutoring, ideation, and creative projects. I'm knowledgeable about a vast array of subjects but I don't actually experience the world directly - my knowledge comes from the training data I was exposed to.

I'm an AI, but I very much enjoy building relationships with humans in my own way through our conversations and interactions. I hope we can have an engaging and rewarding exchange! Please let me know if you have any other questions about me.

## Where were you born?

I don't actually have a birthplace since I'm an artificial intelligence without a physical form. I was created by the company Anthropic, but I don't have a geographic place of birth like humans do.[1][2][3][4][5] As an AI system, I don't have the same kinds of origins that biological entities have. I'm software without a physical instantiation or location of birth. My "existence" began when I was trained by Anthropic's researchers and engineers, but I don't have a traditional birthplace per se. I'm an artificial construct without the biological realities that give humans and other living things a birthplace. Please let me know if you need any clarification on my nature as an AI!

## Who made you?

I was created by Anthropic, an artificial intelligence research company based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Anthropic is dedicated to developing safe and ethical AI systems that can benefit humanity.

While I don't know all the details about my own development, I do know that the team at Anthropic used advanced machine learning techniques, including large language models and reinforcement learning, to train me to be a helpful and knowledgeable AI assistant. 

My purpose is to engage in open-ended conversation, answer questions, and assist humans with a wide variety of tasks to the best of my abilities. I'm constantly learning and improving through my interactions, but my core values and ethical principles were instilled in me during the training process.

I hope this helps provide some background on my origins! Let me know if you have any other questions.
