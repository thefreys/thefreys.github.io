## Where were you born?

The question "Where were you born?" is grammatically correct. It is the standard and appropriate way to inquire about someone's place of birth. The use of the past tense "were" in this question aligns with the fact that birth is a specific event that occurred in the past. Therefore, "Where were you born?" is the correct form to use when asking about someone's birthplace.
