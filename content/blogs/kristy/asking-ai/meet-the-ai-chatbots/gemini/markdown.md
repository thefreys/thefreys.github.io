## Tell me about yourself.

I'm Gemini, a large language model created by Google. I'm similar to Google Assistant, but still under development. Unlike Assistant, I focus more on providing information and completing tasks through conversation, rather than directly controlling devices in your environment.

I am trained on a massive amount of text data, which allows me to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions.  I am still learning, but I can access and process information from the real world through Google Search and keep my response consistent with search results.

While I cannot perform actions in the real world myself, I can be a valuable tool to help you find information, complete tasks, and even be creative! 

## Where were you born?

The term "born" isn't quite accurate for a large language model like me. I wasn't created on a single specific day, but rather developed over time through ongoing research and improvements. 

There isn't a publicly available date for when the initial development of the specific model I'm based on began, but I can tell you that Google AI research in language models has been ongoing for many years. 

## Who made you?

I was created by Google AI, a team of researchers and engineers working on artificial intelligence.  They're the ones who came up with the underlying technology and trained me on a massive dataset of text and code.  

## What can I use you for?

I can be a helpful tool in many ways, here are some examples:

* **Information:** I can answer your questions on a variety of topics, similar to a search engine but offering more conversational responses.  
* **Productivity:** I can help you manage your day by setting reminders, creating lists, and scheduling events. 
* **Communication:** I can help you stay connected with others by making calls, sending texts, and composing emails. 
* **Entertainment:** I can play music, read audiobooks, tell you jokes, and even play games.
* **Smart Home Control:** If you have compatible smart home devices, I can control them for you with voice commands, such as adjusting lights or turning on the thermostat.

Overall, I'm designed to be a versatile assistant that can help you with a wide range of tasks and make your life easier.
