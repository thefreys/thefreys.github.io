To list all files with the .html extension in the current folder recursively, you can use the `find` command. Here is the command you can use:

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.html"
```

This command will list all files with the .html extension in the current folder and its subfolders. Here is what each part of the command does:

- `find`: This command searches for files and directories.
- `.`: This specifies the directory to start the search from. In this case, it is the current directory.
- `-type f`: This specifies that we are only interested in files, not directories.
- `-name "*.html"`: This specifies that we are only interested in files with the .html extension.

I hope this helps!
