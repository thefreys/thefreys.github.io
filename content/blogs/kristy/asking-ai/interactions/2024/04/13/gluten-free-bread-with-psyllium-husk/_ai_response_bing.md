### No-Knead Gluten-Free Bread With Psyllium Husk

#### Why You'll Love This Recipe:
- **Texture**: Psyllium husk makes the bread incredibly soft and moist.
- **Flavor**: The bread is so tasty you'll keep snacking on it all day long. Try it in grilled cheese for even more flavor!

#### Ingredients:
- **Gluten-free flour**: Use an all-purpose gluten-free flour blend (nightshade-free if preferred).
- **Psyllium husk**: Use whole husks, not psyllium husk powder. Whole husks give the best results.
- **Yeast**: You can use active dry yeast or fresh yeast.
- **Apple cider vinegar**: Helps the yeast thrive.
- **Water**: Use tap water (if drinkable) or bottled water.

#### Substitutes:
- **Psyllium husk**: There's no perfect substitute, but if you only have psyllium husk powder, use 17g (9.5 tsp) of it. Don't reduce the water.
- **Sugar**: You can use honey or maple syrup instead of sugar.
- **Yeast**: Any type of yeast works. For dry yeast, use 8g (2.5-3 tsp).

#### Step-By-Step Instructions:
1. Mix the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, combine gluten-free flour and psyllium husk.
2. Add yeast: Mix in the yeast.
3. Add wet ingredients: Whisk together apple cider vinegar and water.
4. Combine: Mix everything until well combined.
5. Let it rise: Cover the bowl and let the dough rise for about 2 hours.
6. Shape and bake: Shape the dough into a loaf, place it in a greased Dutch oven, and bake at 450¬∞F (230¬∞C) for 30 minutes with the lid on, then 15 minutes with the lid off.

#### Expert Tips:
