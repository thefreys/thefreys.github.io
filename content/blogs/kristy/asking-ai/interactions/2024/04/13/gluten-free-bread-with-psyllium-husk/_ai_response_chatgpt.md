Certainly! Here's a simple recipe for gluten-free bread using psyllium husk powder:

### Ingredients:
- 2 cups gluten-free flour blend (such as a mix of rice flour, potato starch, and tapioca flour)
- 1/2 cup psyllium husk powder
- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (for yeast activation)
- 1 1/2 cups warm water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil or melted coconut oil
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

### Instructions:

1. **Activate the yeast**: In a small bowl, mix the warm water with honey or maple syrup. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.

2. **Mix dry ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, psyllium husk powder, and salt until well combined.

3. **Combine wet ingredients**: Add the olive oil (or melted coconut oil) and apple cider vinegar to the yeast mixture once it's frothy. Mix well.

4. **Mix the dough**: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a sticky dough forms. Use a spatula or your hands to combine everything thoroughly.

5. **Let the dough rise**: Transfer the dough to a greased loaf pan lined with parchment paper. Smooth out the top with wet hands if necessary. Cover the pan with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, until it doubles in size.

6. **Preheat the oven**: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) towards the end of the rising time.

7. **Bake the bread**: Once the dough has risen, bake it in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.

8. **Cool and slice**: Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.

9. **Enjoy**: Slice and enjoy your homemade gluten-free bread with your favorite toppings!

Feel free to customize this recipe by adding seeds, herbs, or other flavorings to the dough before baking. And remember, gluten-free bread can sometimes be a bit denser than traditional bread, but the psyllium husk powder helps give it structure and texture.
