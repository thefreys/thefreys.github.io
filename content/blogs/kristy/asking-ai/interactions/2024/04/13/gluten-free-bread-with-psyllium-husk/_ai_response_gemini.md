Absolutely, here's a recipe for a delicious gluten-free bread that uses psyllium husk powder:

**Ingredients:**

*  1.5 cups warm water (360 ml)
*  11 grams dry yeast (4.5 teaspoons)
*  1 tablespoon psyllium husk powder (optional, if your flour blend doesn't already contain it)
*  3 tablespoons maple syrup or honey
*  3 tablespoons olive oil
*  2 teaspoons salt
*  2 – 2.5 cups all-purpose gluten-free flour blend (480 – 600 ml)
*  2 egg whites

**Instructions:**

1.  In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar, and 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons of warm water. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, or until the mixture becomes frothy. This activates the yeast.
2.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the psyllium husk powder (if using) with the remaining 1 cup of warm water. It will quickly form a gel.
3.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and salt.
4.  Add the activated yeast mixture, psyllium husk gel, olive oil, maple syrup, and egg whites to the dry ingredients.
5.  Using a spoon or a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment, mix the dough until it becomes smooth and starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl. You might need to add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if the dough feels too sticky.
6.  Lightly grease a loaf pan and transfer the dough to the pan.
7.  Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.
8.  Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
9.  Bake the bread for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
10.  Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing.

**Tips:**

*  For a denser bread, use less water (start with 1.25 cups and add more if needed).
*  You can experiment with different types of gluten-free flour blends. Some popular options include almond flour, coconut flour, oat flour, and tapioca flour.
*  If you don't have maple syrup or honey, you can use another liquid sweetener, such as agave nectar.
*  For a richer flavor, you can add 1/4 cup of chopped nuts or seeds to the dough.

Enjoy your delicious homemade gluten-free bread!
