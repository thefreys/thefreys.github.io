Sure! Here is a recipe for gluten-free bread that utilizes psyllium husk powder: 

**Ingredients:**
- 2 cups gluten-free flour (a blend, not a single type)
- 1/4 cup psyllium husk powder
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon instant yeast
- 1 tablespoon honey or granulated sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 cup oil
- 1 to 1 1/4 cups warm water

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease a standard loaf pan.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, psyllium husk powder, baking powder, salt, and instant yeast. Mix well to ensure there are no lumps.

3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the honey (or sugar), eggs, and oil until well combined.

4. Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing as you pour. Gradually add the warm water and continue mixing until you have a thick, sticky batter. The amount of water you need may vary depending on your flour blend.

5. Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan, using a wet spatula to smooth the top.

6. Bake the bread for 45-55 minutes, or until the crust is deep brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped.

7. Let the bread cool in the pan for a few minutes, then turn it out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.

This recipe creates a soft, moist, and flavorful gluten-free bread. The psyllium husk powder helps to bind the ingredients together and provides a pleasant texture. 

Feel free to experiment with different gluten-free flour blends to find your preferred taste and texture. You can also try adding seeds or dried herbs to the batter for additional flavor. Enjoy your homemade gluten-free bread!
