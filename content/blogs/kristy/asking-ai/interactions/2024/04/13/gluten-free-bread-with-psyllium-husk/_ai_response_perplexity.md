Here is a gluten-free bread recipe that uses psyllium husk powder:

## Gluten-Free Bread with Psyllium Husk Powder

Ingredients:
- 3 cups (438g) gluten-free all-purpose flour blend
- 1 packet (2 1/4 tsp, 9g) instant rapid rise yeast
- 1 tablespoon (11g) psyllium husk powder
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups (360g) warm water (110째F)
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 1/4 cup (85g) honey
- 1/4 cup (55g) vegetable oil

Instructions:

1. In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mix together the gluten-free flour, yeast, psyllium husk powder, baking powder, and salt on low speed until combined.

2. Add the warm water, eggs, honey, and vegetable oil. Mix on low speed until the dough comes together.

3. Increase the speed to medium and mix for 2-3 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.

4. Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and smooth the top.

5. Cover the pan and let the dough rise for 30-40 minutes, until it has risen just above the top of the pan.

6. Preheat the oven to 375째F (190째C).

7. Bake the bread for 45-55 minutes, until the top is golden brown. The internal temperature should reach 205-210째F.

8. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.

The psyllium husk powder helps bind the gluten-free flours together and gives the bread a soft, flexible texture. Enjoy your homemade gluten-free bread!
