#### **Gluten-Free Bread Recipe with Psyllium Husk Powder**

When making gluten-free bread with psyllium husk powder, it's important to adjust the quantity of psyllium husk to ensure the best results. Here's a recipe that incorporates psyllium husk powder:

**Ingredients:**
- 300g gluten-free flour blend
- 10g psyllium husk powder
- 7g instant yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp honey or maple syrup
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 300ml warm water

**Instructions:**
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, psyllium husk powder, instant yeast, and salt.
2. Add the honey or maple syrup, olive oil, and warm water to the dry ingredients.
3. Mix the ingredients together until a sticky dough forms.
4. Transfer the dough to a greased loaf pan and smooth out the top.
5. Cover the loaf pan with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.
6. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
7. Once the dough has risen, place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
8. Remove the bread from the loaf pan and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing.
