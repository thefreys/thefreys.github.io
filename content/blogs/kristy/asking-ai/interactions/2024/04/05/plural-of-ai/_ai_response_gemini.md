The plural of AI depends on how you're using it.

* **AI as a field of study:**  
  In this case, AI is treated as a singular concept, much like  "mathematics" or "physics."  So you would say "The field of AI is rapidly advancing."

* **AI referring to specific systems:**
  If you're talking about multiple specific artificial intelligence systems, then the plural would be "AIs." For instance, "We are developing several AIs to tackle different challenges." 

Here's a helpful point: "Artificial intelligence" itself can also be pluralized as "artificial intelligences" if you're referring to different types of AI.
