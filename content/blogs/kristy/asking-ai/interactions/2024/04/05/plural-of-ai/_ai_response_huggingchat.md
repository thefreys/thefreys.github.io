 The plural of "AI" (artificial intelligence) can be either "AIs" or "artificial intelligences," depending on whether you are referring to multiple instances of artificial intelligence systems or simply using it as a general term for more than one type of such system. Both forms are commonly used in different contexts, and both are grammatically correct.

For example:

* AIs: I am comparing the performance of several AIs to determine which one performs best.
* Artificial intelligences: We need to consider ethical issues related to the development of artificial intelligences that may surpass human capabilities.
