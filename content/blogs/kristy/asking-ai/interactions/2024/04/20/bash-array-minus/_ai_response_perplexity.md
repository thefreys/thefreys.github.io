Yes, it is possible to subtract one array from another in Bash. Here is how you can do it:

The key steps are:

1. Iterate through the first array (`Array1`)
2. For each element in `Array1`, check if it exists in the second array (`Array2`)
3. If the element is not in `Array2`, add it to the output array (`Array3`)

Here is an example implementation:

```bash
Array1=(5 6 7 8)
Array2=(1 2 3 4)

Array3=()
for element in "${Array1[@]}"; do
    if ! [[ " ${Array2[*]} " == *" $element "* ]]; then
        Array3+=("$element")
    fi
done

echo "Array1: ${Array1[*]}"
echo "Array2: ${Array2[*]}"
echo "Array3: ${Array3[*]}"
```

This will output:

```
Array1: 5 6 7 8
Array2: 1 2 3 4
Array3: 5 6 7 8
```

The key steps are:

1. We initialize an empty array `Array3` to store the result.
2. We loop through each element in `Array1` using a `for` loop.
3. For each element, we check if it exists in `Array2` using the `[[ ... ]]` construct and the `*" $element "*` pattern matching. The `" ${Array2[*]} "` ensures we match the entire element, not just a substring.
4. If the element is not found in `Array2`, we add it to `Array3`.
5. Finally, we print out the three arrays.

This approach ensures that `Array3` contains only the elements that are present in `Array1` but not in `Array2`, which is the desired subtraction operation.
