#### Deduplicating Lines from Two Files in Bash

Yes, it is possible to deduplicate the lines from two files into a third file in Bash. One way to achieve this is by using the `sort` and `uniq` commands. Here's a simple example of how you can do this:

```bash
sort file1 file2 | uniq > file3
```

This command will combine the lines from `file1` and `file2`, sort them, and then remove any duplicate lines, saving the result in `file3`.

Another approach involves using a pure Bash solution that takes advantage of associative arrays. This method is particularly useful for large files and can be implemented in Bash 4 or later.

It's important to note that the `sort` command is used to ensure that duplicate lines are adjacent to each other, which is a requirement for the `uniq` command to work effectively. If the lines are not sorted, the `uniq` command will not be able to remove all duplicate lines.

In summary, by using the `sort` and `uniq` commands, or a pure Bash solution with associative arrays, you can deduplicate the lines from two files into a third file in Bash.
