Yes, in Bash, you can subtract one array from another by iterating over the elements of the first array and removing any that are found in the second array. Here's a simple script that demonstrates how to do this:

```bash
# Define two arrays
array1=(1 2 3 4 5)
array2=(3 4 5 6 7)

# Subtract array2 from array1
for i in "${!array1[@]}"; do
  for j in "${array2[@]}"; do
    if [[ "${array1[i]}" == "$j" ]]; then
      unset 'array1[i]'
    fi
  done
done

# Re-index the array
array1=("${array1[@]}")

echo "Resulting array: ${array1[@]}"
```

This script will output the resulting array after the subtraction, which in this case would be `(1 2)`, since `3`, `4`, and `5` have been removed from `array1`.
