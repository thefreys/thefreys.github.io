Yes, it's possible to deduplicate lines from two files into a third file using bash. Here's how you can achieve it:

**Method 1: Using grep and redirection**

This approach uses `grep` to filter out duplicate lines.

1. **Find lines not present in the second file:**

```bash
grep -vxFf file2.txt file1.txt > deduplicated.txt
```

Here's a breakdown of the options:

* `-v`: Inverts the selection, printing only non-matching lines.
* `-x`: Matches entire lines.
* `-F`: Treats the pattern as a fixed string (not a regular expression).
* `-f file2.txt`: Reads patterns (lines) from file2.txt.
* `file1.txt`: The first file from which lines are read.
* `> deduplicated.txt`: Redirects the output (unique lines) to a new file named "deduplicated.txt".

2. (Optional) You can append the unique lines from the second file to the deduplicated file:

```bash
cat file2.txt >> deduplicated.txt
```

This command appends the content of `file2.txt` to the end of `deduplicated.txt`, effectively combining the unique lines from both files.

**Method 2: Using comm (if available)**

This method uses the `comm` command, which is specifically designed for comparing sorted files. However, it might not be available on all systems.

1. **Sort the files first:**

```bash
sort file1.txt > file1.sorted.txt
sort file2.txt > file2.sorted.txt
```

2. **Use comm to find unique lines (ignoring common lines):**

```bash
comm -12 file1.sorted.txt file2.sorted.txt > deduplicated.txt
```

* `-1`: Print only lines unique to the first file (file1.sorted.txt).
* `-2`: Print only lines unique to the second file (file2.sorted.txt).

This approach outputs both unique lines from each file into `deduplicated.txt`.

**Note:**

* Both methods assume the files are using the same line ending format (e.g., LF for Unix, CRLF for Windows).
* Remember to replace `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `deduplicated.txt` with your actual filenames.
