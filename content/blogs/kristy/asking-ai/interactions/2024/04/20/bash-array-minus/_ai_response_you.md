#### Is it possible to subtract one array from another in bash?

Yes, it is possible to subtract one array from another in bash. There are several methods to achieve this, including using native bash operations, external tools like jq, and parameter expansion. Here are some ways to accomplish array subtraction in bash:

1. **Using Array Difference in Bash**: Utilize native bash operations to find the difference between arrays and create a new array with unique elements.
