Yes, it is possible to remove duplicate lines from two files and write the unique lines to a third file using bash. Here is one way to do it:

```bash
# Combine the two files into one
cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt

# Remove duplicate lines and write to output file
awk '!seen[$0]++' combined.txt > output.txt
```

The key steps are:

1. Concatenate the two input files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` into a single file `combined.txt` using the `cat` command.
2. Use the `awk` command with the `!seen[$0]++` pattern to remove duplicate lines from the `combined.txt` file and write the unique lines to the `output.txt` file.

The `awk` command works as follows:

- `!seen[$0]++` - This creates an associative array `seen` that keeps track of the lines that have been seen before. 
- The `!` (logical NOT) operator inverts the boolean value, so lines that have not been seen before (i.e. `seen[$0]` is false) will be printed.
- The `++` increments the value in the `seen` array for each line, so duplicate lines will have a non-zero value in `seen` and will be filtered out.

This approach maintains the original order of the lines in the output file.
