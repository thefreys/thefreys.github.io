Yes, in Bash, you can deduplicate lines from two files and output the unique lines into a third file. Here's a simple way to do it using `awk`:

```bash
awk '!seen[$0]++' file1.txt file2.txt > deduped_file.txt
```

This command will read `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, remove any duplicate lines, and write the unique lines to `deduped_file.txt`. The `awk` command uses an associative array `seen` to keep track of lines that have already been printed, ensuring that duplicates are not printed again. If you want to preserve the order of lines and avoid sorting, this method is efficient and effective¹².
