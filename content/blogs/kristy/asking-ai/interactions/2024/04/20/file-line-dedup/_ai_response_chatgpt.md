Yes, you can deduplicate the lines from two files into a third file using various methods in bash. One way to achieve this is by using the `sort` and `uniq` commands together. Here's a basic example:

```bash
sort file1.txt file2.txt | uniq > output.txt
```

This command sorts the lines from both `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` together, and then `uniq` removes any duplicate consecutive lines. The result is then redirected to `output.txt`.

If you want to maintain the order of lines as they appear in the original files, you can use `awk`:

```bash
awk '!seen[$0]++' file1.txt file2.txt > output.txt
```

This `awk` command keeps track of lines seen in an array and prints lines only if they haven't been seen before. This preserves the order of lines from the original files.

Remember to replace `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `output.txt` with the actual filenames you're working with.
