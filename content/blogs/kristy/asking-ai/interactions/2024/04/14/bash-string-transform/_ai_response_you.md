#### Converting String to Title Case in Bash

To transform a string variable in bash so that the dashes become spaces and the words are capitalized properly, you can use the following approach:

1. **Replace Dashes with Spaces:**
   - Use the `sed` command to replace dashes with spaces in the string variable.
   - Example: `title=$(echo "$title" | sed 's/-/ /g')`

2. **Capitalize First Letter of Each Word:**
   - Use the `awk` command to capitalize the first letter of each word in the string variable.
   - Example: `title=$(echo "$title" | awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++)sub(/./,toupper(substr($i,1,1)),$i)}1')`

By combining these two commands, you can achieve the desired transformation of the string variable in bash.
