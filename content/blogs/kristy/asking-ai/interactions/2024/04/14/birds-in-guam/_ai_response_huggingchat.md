The bird population in Guam has been severely impacted by the introduction of the brown tree snake, an invasive species that was accidentally introduced to the island after World War II. The brown tree snake, native to Papua New Guinea and northern Australia, has no natural predators in Guam and has caused significant damage to the island's ecosystem.

The snake has been responsible for the extinction or near-extinction of many bird species on the island, including the Guam flycatcher, the Guam kingfisher, and the Mariana crow. The snake preys on birds, their eggs, and their hatchlings, and has also been known to compete with birds for food and habitat.

In addition to the direct impact on bird populations, the loss of birds has had a ripple effect on the island's ecosystem. Birds play an important role in seed dispersal and pollination, and their absence has led to a decline in plant diversity and changes in the structure of the forest.

Efforts are underway to control the brown tree snake population and restore the island's ecosystem, but the recovery of bird populations in Guam is a slow and challenging process.
