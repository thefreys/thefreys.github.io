The native bird species of **Guam** dramatically declined for a variety of reasons. One of the primary factors was the introduction of **predatory animals** by humans. These animals, such as **feral pigs**, **cats**, and **snakes**, preyed on the native birds and their eggs. Another factor was the **loss of native habitat** due to development and agriculture‚Å∏. Let's delve deeper into the situation:

1. **Habitat Destruction**:
   - The dramatic decline in Guam's native bird species can be largely attributed to **habitat destruction**. Rapid development of natural habitats on the island has caused **fragmentation** and loss of suitable nesting sites for many birds.
   - A lack of proper land management has further degraded existing habitats, leading to even more drastic declines in bird populations.
   - Increased urbanization and agricultural activities like logging, mining, and overgrazing have put pressure on remaining native habitats, pushing avian species into smaller areas where they struggle to survive‚Å∂.

2. **Invasive Predators**:
   - **Brown tree snakes**, introduced to Guam after World War II, played a significant role in the decline of native bird populations. These invasive snakes preyed on birds and their eggs, creating a "silent forest" devoid of bird song.
   - The **Guam Kingfisher**, known as "Sihek" in the indigenous Chamorro language, was spared from extinction when biologists brought the remaining 29 birds into captivity. Today, nearly 140 Sihek live in facilities worldwide, but their survival depends on successful reintroduction to the wild‚Å∑.

3. **Challenges in Reintroduction**:
   - Ideally, biologists would reintroduce Sihek into their native Guam forests. However, Guam still can't sustain wild Sihek due to the unyielding presence of brown tree snakes.
   - Expanding chick production, with a boost from wild birds after successful introduction, remains the species' best shot at survival‚Å∑.

Preserving Guam's avian wildlife requires concerted efforts to address habitat loss, control invasive species, and promote conservation. Let's hope that steps are taken to protect these unique and beautiful creatures before it's too late! üåøüê¶
