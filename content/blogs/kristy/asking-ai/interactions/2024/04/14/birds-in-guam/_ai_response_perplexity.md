According to the search results, the Guam rail and other native bird species on the island of Guam were devastated by the introduction of the invasive brown tree snake:

- Prior to the arrival of the brown tree snake, Guam had 11 native species of forest-dwelling birds. However, after the snake was introduced to the island, likely by a U.S. Navy supply ship in the mid-1900s, 9 of those 11 native bird species disappeared entirely within a few decades. [2]

- The brown tree snake, which can grow up to 3 meters long, had no natural predators on Guam and rapidly decimated the native bird populations by preying on their eggs and chicks. [1][2]

- As a result, the Guam rail was declared extinct in the wild in the late 1980s, with only 21 birds remaining that were taken into captivity for a breeding program. [1][3]

- The Guam kingfisher was also declared extinct in the wild in 1986 due to the impacts of the invasive brown tree snake and other introduced predators like cats and rats. [4]

So in summary, the introduction of the highly invasive and predatory brown tree snake led to the near-complete extirpation of Guam's native avifauna, with 9 out of 11 species disappearing entirely from the wild. Only through intensive captive breeding and reintroduction efforts have a few species, like the Guam rail, been able to make a comeback. [1][2][3][4]
