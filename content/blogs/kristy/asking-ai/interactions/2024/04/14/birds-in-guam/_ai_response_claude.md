The birds of Guam faced a tragic decline due to the introduction of the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) to the island.

Here's a summary of what happened:

- The brown tree snake, native to parts of Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea, was accidentally introduced to Guam, likely via military cargo or equipment, sometime in the 1940s or 1950s.

- Without any native predators, the brown tree snake population exploded on Guam. These snakes are excellent climbers and prey on birds, lizards, and other small animals.

- As the snake population grew, it decimated Guam's native bird species. Many birds, such as the Guam rail, Guam flycatcher, and Micronesian kingfisher, were driven to extinction in the wild on Guam.

- By the 1980s, over 10 native bird species had been completely wiped out on the island, and several others were on the brink of extinction. The brown tree snake was responsible for the largest recorded avian extinction event of the 20th century.

- Conservation efforts have tried to control the brown tree snake population and reintroduce some endangered bird species, but the damage done to Guam's avian diversity has been catastrophic and largely irreversible. The ecological impact is still felt on the island today.

The story of Guam's birds serves as a tragic example of the devastation that can be caused by the introduction of invasive predator species to isolated ecosystems. It highlights the importance of biosecurity measures to prevent such ecological disasters.
