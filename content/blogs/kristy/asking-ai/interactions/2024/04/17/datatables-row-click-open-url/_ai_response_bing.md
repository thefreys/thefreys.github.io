Certainly! To make a row clickable in DataTables and open a URL specified in the 4th column, you can use the `columns.render` option. Here's an example of how to achieve this:

```javascript
$('#your-table-id').DataTable({
  columns: [
    // Other column definitions...
    {
      title: 'URL',
      render: function(data, type, row) {
        // Assuming your URL is in the 4th column (index 3)
        var url = row[3]; // Get the URL from the row data
        return '<a href="' + url + '" target="_blank">Open Link</a>';
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

In the above code:
- Replace `'your-table-id'` with the actual ID of your DataTable.
- The `render` function extracts the URL from the row data (assuming it's in the 4th column) and creates a clickable link that opens in a new tab.

Feel free to adjust the column index and customize the link text as needed! ðŸ˜Š
