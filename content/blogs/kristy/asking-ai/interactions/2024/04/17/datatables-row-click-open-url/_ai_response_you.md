#### Implementing Clickable Rows in DataTables

To make each row in a DataTable clickable and open a URL specified in the 4th column, you can use the DataTables API to achieve this functionality. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this:

1. **Use Render Function**: You can use the `render` function to create a hyperlink in the 4th column of the table. This function allows you to manipulate the data before it is displayed in the table. Here's an example of how to use the `render` function to create a clickable link in the 4th column:
   ```javascript
   {
       data: null,
       render: function (data, type, row) {
           return '<a href="' + data[3] + '" target="_blank">Link Text</a>';
       }
   }
   ```
   This code snippet creates a hyperlink in the 4th column of the table, where the URL is taken from the data in the 4th column.

2. **Handle Click Event**: To handle the click event on the row and navigate to the URL, you can use jQuery to attach a click event to the rows. Here's an example of how to achieve this:
   ```javascript
   var table = $('#example').DataTable();
   $('#example tbody').on('click', 'tr', function () {
       var data = table.row(this).data();
       window.location = data[3]; // Navigate to the URL in the 4th column
   });
   ```
   In this code, a click event is attached to the rows in the table, and when a row is clicked, it navigates to the URL specified in the 4th column.

By using the `render` function and handling the click event, you can make each row in the DataTable clickable and open the URL specified in the 4th column.

These methods leverage the DataTables API and jQuery to achieve the desired functionality.
