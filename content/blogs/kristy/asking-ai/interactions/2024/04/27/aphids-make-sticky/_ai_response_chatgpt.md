It sounds like you might indeed have an aphid problem. Here's what you can do to mitigate them:

1. **Isolation**: Separate the affected plants from the rest of your indoor plants to prevent the aphids from spreading.

2. **Inspect**: Examine the plants closely to confirm the presence of aphids. They are usually small, soft-bodied insects that can be green, black, brown, red, or white.

3. **Manual Removal**: Use a gentle stream of water to wash the aphids off the plants. You can also use a soft brush or cloth to physically remove them.

4. **Natural Predators**: Introduce natural predators of aphids, such as ladybugs or lacewings, to your indoor garden. They can help keep the aphid population in check.

5. **Neem Oil**: Neem oil is an effective organic solution for controlling aphids. Mix it with water according to the instructions on the product and spray it onto the affected plants.

6. **Insecticidal Soap**: Insecticidal soap can also be effective against aphids. Make sure to use a soap specifically formulated for plants and follow the instructions carefully.

7. **Pruning**: If the infestation is severe, consider pruning heavily infested parts of the plant. This can help reduce the aphid population and allow the plant to recover.

8. **Monitor**: Keep a close eye on your plants after treatment to ensure that the aphids are not returning. Repeat treatment if necessary.

By taking these steps, you should be able to mitigate the aphid problem and protect your indoor succulents.
