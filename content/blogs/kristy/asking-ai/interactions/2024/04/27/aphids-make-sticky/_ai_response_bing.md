Dealing with aphids on your indoor succulents can be frustrating, but there are several effective methods to mitigate them:

1. **Manual Removal**: If you notice only a few aphids, you can manually remove them using a dry paper towel. After removing the aphids, use a wet paper towel to clean any sap or residue to prevent further infestation¹[1].

2. **Water Spray**: For a larger infestation, use a strong stream of water to blast the aphids off your succulents. Make sure to spray the underside of the leaves and let them dry completely. Repeat this process daily until the aphids are gone¹[1].

3. **Insecticidal Soap**: This is a common and effective treatment. You can apply insecticidal soap to the affected areas of your succulents to kill the aphids on contact¹[1].

4. **Neem Oil**: Neem oil is a natural pesticide that can be sprayed on the succulents. It works by smothering the aphids and disrupting their hormone system, which stops them from breeding²[5].

5. **Diatomaceous Earth**: This is a non-toxic powder that can be sprinkled around the stem or mixed with water and sprayed over the leaves. It kills aphids by dehydrating them³[3].

6. **Alcohol Spray**: A mixture of alcohol and water can be sprayed on the succulents to kill the aphids. Be sure to wipe it off after a few hours to prevent damage to the plants⁴[4].

Remember to isolate the affected plants to prevent the aphids from spreading to your other indoor plants. Regular inspection and prompt action are key to keeping your succulents healthy. If the infestation persists, you might want to consult with a professional for more targeted advice.
