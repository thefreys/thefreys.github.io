Here are some steps you can take to deal with aphids on your indoor succulents:

1. Inspect the plants carefully and check for aphid colonies, especially on new growth, undersides of leaves, and in crevices. Aphids are small pear-shaped insects that cluster together.

2. Start by removing the infested parts of the plant if possible. Use scissors or pruners to cut off heavily infested leaves/stems and discard them.

3. Take the plants to the sink or shower and spray them thoroughly with a strong stream of water. This will dislodge and remove many of the aphids.

4. Use an insecticidal soap or neem oil spray made for houseplants. Spray all plant surfaces thoroughly, making sure to get the undersides of leaves. These products smother and kill the aphids.

5. Repeat the insecticidal soap/neem oil application every 5-7 days for 2-3 weeks to kill any newly hatched aphids.

6. Isolate any heavily infested plants away from your other plants until you get the aphid population under control.

7. After treating, wipe off any sticky honeydew residue left behind by the aphids with a damp cloth.

8. Encourage natural predators like ladybugs or lacewings if your succulents are outdoors during warm months.

Persistence is key as aphids reproduce quickly. But with diligent treatment, you can eliminate them from your succulents.
