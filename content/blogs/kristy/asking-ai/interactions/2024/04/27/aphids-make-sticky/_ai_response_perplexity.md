Based on the search results provided, here is how you can address the aphid infestation on your indoor succulents:

The most effective ways to get rid of aphids on succulents are:

1. Spray the succulents with a homemade solution of water, liquid soap, and optionally a bit of cayenne pepper. This will kill the aphids on contact. Repeat this treatment for a few days to fully eliminate the infestation.[1]

2. Use a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution diluted with water and liquid soap. Spray this on the succulents, focusing on the undersides of leaves where aphids like to hide. The alcohol will kill the aphids.[1][3][4]

3. Introduce natural aphid predators like ladybugs, lacewings, or parasitic wasps to your indoor environment. These beneficial insects will help control the aphid population naturally.[1][2]

4. Physically remove the aphids by hand or by spraying the succulents with a strong stream of water to knock them off. Dispose of the aphids in soapy water.[2][3]

It's important to act quickly, as aphids reproduce rapidly and can quickly spread from plant to plant. Thoroughly inspect all your succulents and treat any infested ones. Repeat the treatments as needed until the aphids are fully eliminated. Isolating affected plants can also help prevent the spread. With diligence, you can get the aphid problem under control.[1][2][3][4]
