#### Identifying the Issue

It seems like your indoor succulents have become sticky after bringing roses from outside into the house, indicating a possible aphid infestation. Aphids are small, soft-bodied insects that feed on plant juices and excrete a sticky substance called honeydew, which can lead to the development of sooty mold, hindering plant growth.

#### Mitigating Aphids on Indoor Succulents

To mitigate the aphid infestation on your indoor succulents, you can consider the following steps:

1. **Inspect and Isolate**: 
   - Inspect the succulents for aphids, especially on the new growth and undersides of leaves. 
   - If possible, isolate the affected succulents to prevent the spread of aphids to other plants.

2. **Physical Removal**:
   - Use a gentle stream of water to wash off the aphids from the succulents. 
   - Consider wiping the aphids off with a damp cloth or cotton swab.

3. **Natural Predators**:
   - Introduce natural predators of aphids, such as ladybugs, into your indoor environment to control the aphid population.

4. **Horticultural Oils or Insecticidal Soaps**:
   - Consider using horticultural oils or insecticidal soaps to control the aphid infestation on your indoor succulents.

5. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Regularly inspect and clean your indoor succulents to prevent future aphid infestations.
   - Avoid bringing potentially infested plants from outside into your indoor environment.

6. **Sticky Traps**:
   - Use sticky paper or strips around your plants to trap any aphids that come to visit.

Remember to monitor the succulents closely after taking these measures to ensure the aphid infestation is under control.
