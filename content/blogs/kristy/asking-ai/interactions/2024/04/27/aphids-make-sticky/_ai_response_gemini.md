Aphids are a common culprit for sticky residue on plants, so it's a good guess. Here's how to tackle the aphid problem and protect your succulents:

**Isolate the roses:** First, move the roses far away from your other houseplants, preferably to a different room. This will prevent the aphids from spreading to other healthy plants.

**Inspect your succulents:** Carefully inspect all your succulents for signs of aphids. They are small, soft-bodied insects that tend to cluster on the undersides of leaves and near new growth.

**Remove aphids manually:** If the infestation is mild, you can remove the aphids manually. A strong blast of water can knock them off, or you can dab them with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol.

**Make an insecticidal soap spray:** This is a natural and effective option for eliminating aphids. Mix a few tablespoons of castile soap with a liter of water. Spray the solution directly on the aphids, making sure to saturate the undersides of leaves. 

**Try neem oil:** Neem oil is another natural option that suffocates aphids and disrupts their life cycle.  Just be sure to dilute it according to the product instructions and apply it in the evening to avoid sun damage to your succulents.

**Encourage natural predators:** Ladybugs and lacewings are natural enemies of aphids. You can introduce these beneficial insects to your indoor garden to help control aphid populations. 

**Repeat treatment:**  Unfortunately, aphids can be persistent, so you may need to repeat the treatment every few days for a week or two to completely eliminate them.
