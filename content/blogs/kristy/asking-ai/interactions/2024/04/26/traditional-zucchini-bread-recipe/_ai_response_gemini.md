## Traditional Zucchini Bread

This recipe yields one loaf of delicious zucchini bread. 

**Ingredients:**

* 1 ½ cups (180g) grated zucchini (about 2 medium zucchini)
* 1 ¾ cups (225g) all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon (5g) baking soda
* 1 ½ teaspoons (9g) ground cinnamon
* ½ teaspoon (3g) salt
* ¼ teaspoon (1g) ground nutmeg (optional)
* ⅔ cup (150g) unsalted butter, softened
* 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* 1 teaspoon (5ml) vanilla extract
* ½ cup (115g) chopped walnuts (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
2. **Grate the zucchini:** In a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, wring out any excess moisture from the grated zucchini. You can grate the zucchini by hand or using the grater attachment on a food processor.
3. **Whisk the dry ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg (if using).
4. **Cream the butter and sugar:** Using an electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 3 minutes.
5. **Beat in the eggs one at a time:** Beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. 
6. **Stir in the vanilla:** Stir in the vanilla extract.
7. **Combine wet and dry ingredients:** Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in three batches, alternating with the grated zucchini and mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
8. **Fold in walnuts (optional):** If using walnuts, fold them gently into the batter.
9. **Pour batter and bake:** Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
10. **Cool and slice:** Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and enjoy!

**Tips:**

* To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the bread. If it comes out clean, the bread is done.
* You can substitute vegetable oil for the butter in a 1:1 ratio (⅔ cup vegetable oil).
* For a richer flavor, substitute brown sugar for half of the granulated sugar (½ cup granulated sugar, ½ cup packed light brown sugar).
* Let your zucchini bread cool completely before slicing for cleaner cuts.
