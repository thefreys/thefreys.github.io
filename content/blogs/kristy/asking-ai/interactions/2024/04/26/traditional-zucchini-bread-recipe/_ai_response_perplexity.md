## Traditional Zucchini Bread Recipe

### Ingredients:

- 3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon (5g) baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon (2.5g) baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon (2.5g) salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoons (7.5g) ground cinnamon
- 3 large eggs (150g)
- 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup (100g) vegetable oil
- 1/4 cup (60ml) unsweetened applesauce
- 1 teaspoon (5ml) vanilla extract
- 2 cups (300g) grated zucchini (about 2 medium zucchinis)
- 1/2 cup (60g) chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)

### Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5 inch (23x13 cm) loaf pan with butter or non-stick cooking spray.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. Set aside.

3. In a large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. Add the vegetable oil, applesauce, and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.

4. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined, being careful not to overmix. Gently fold in the grated zucchini and chopped nuts (if using).

5. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top.

6. Bake for 55-65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the zucchini bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.

Enjoy your homemade traditional zucchini bread! The combination of moist zucchini, warm spices, and optional nuts makes for a delicious and comforting quick bread.
