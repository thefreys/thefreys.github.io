It's great that you're looking to combat fake news! Here's the challenge: Providing a definitive list of "top" fake news sites is difficult because:

* New ones pop up all the time. 
* Some obscure sites can be very effective at spreading misinformation within specific communities.
* Some sites blur the lines between satire, bias, and factual reporting. 

What can be helpful  is learning how to spot fake news yourself. Here are some resources that can help:

* **Fact-checkers:** These organizations research and debunk false claims. Some well-known ones include PolitiFact [https://www.politifact.com/](https://www.politifact.com/), FactCheck.org [https://www.factcheck.org/](https://www.factcheck.org/), and Snopes [https://www.snopes.com/](https://www.snopes.com/). They allow you to search for claims you've seen online. 
* **Media Bias/Fact Check websites:** These list websites and rate their sources and factual reporting [https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/).

Here are some additional tips for spotting fake news:

* **Be skeptical of headlines:** Sensationalized or emotionally charged headlines are often red flags.
* **Check the source:** Is it a reputable news organization? Can you find the author's information? 
* **Look for evidence:** Does the article cite credible sources? 
* **Be wary of poor grammar and spelling.**
* **Do a quick fact-check:** Search for the main claim of the article to see if it has been debunked.

By developing your own critical thinking skills, you'll be better equipped to identify and avoid fake news, regardless of the source.
