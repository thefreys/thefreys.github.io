Here is a traditional zucchini bread recipe with imperial measurements and gram conversions: 

Ingredients: 

- 3 large eggs
- 2 cups (400 g) white sugar
- 1 cup (240 ml) vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) vanilla extract
- 2 cups (450 g) grated zucchini
- 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- Optional: ½ cup (60 g) chopped walnuts

Instructions: 

- Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease two 8x4-inch loaf pans.
- In a large bowl, beat the eggs until light and frothy. Add the sugar, oil, and vanilla extract, mixing well after each addition.
- Stir in the grated zucchini.
- In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and baking powder.
- Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Fold in the walnuts if using.
- Divide the batter evenly between the prepared loaf pans.
- Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaves comes out clean.
- Let the loaves cool in the pans for about 20 minutes, then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
- Enjoy your zucchini bread! It will stay fresh at room temperature for about 3-4 days if wrapped tightly.
