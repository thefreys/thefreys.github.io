Here is a traditional zucchini bread recipe with imperial and metric measurements:
Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (285g)
1 teaspoon baking powder (5g)
1 teaspoon baking soda (5g)
1 teaspoon salt (5g)
1 cup granulated sugar (200g)
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (115g)
2 large eggs (120g)
2 cups grated zucchini (250g)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (5g)
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (60g) (optional)
Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat sugar and butter until light and fluffy.
Beat in eggs one at a time, then beat in vanilla extract.
With the mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture and mix until just combined.
Stir in grated zucchini and chopped walnuts (if using).
Divide batter evenly between prepared loaf pans.
Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of each loaf comes out clean.
Remove from oven and let cool in pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Enjoy your delicious homemade zucchini bread!
Note: To ensure accurate measurements, it's best to use a digital kitchen scale to measure ingredients by weight (in grams). If you don't have a scale, use the imperial measurements as a guide.
