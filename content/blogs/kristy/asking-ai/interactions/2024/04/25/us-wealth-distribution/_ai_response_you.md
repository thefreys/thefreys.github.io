#### Wealth Distribution in the United States Since 1950

The distribution of wealth in the United States has been a topic of significant interest and concern over the years. Here's a summary of the share of wealth held by the top 1 percent each year since 1950 based on the provided search results:

- As of 2007, the richest 1% held about 38% of all privately held wealth in the United States, while the bottom 90% held 73.2% of all debt.
- The best survey data show that the share of wealth held by the top 1 percent rose from 30 percent in 1989 to 39 percent in 2016, while the share held by the bottom 90 percent fell from 33 percent to 23 percent.
- In the third quarter of 2023, 66.9 percent of the total wealth in the United States was owned by the top 10 percent of earners. The top 1 percent held about half of that wealth, approximately 32.1 percent.
- The top 20 percent held 77 percent of total household wealth in 2016, more than triple what the middle class held, defined as the middle 60 percent of the usual income distribution. The top one percent alone held more wealth than the middle class, owning 29 percent of household wealth in 2016.

Based on these snippets, it's evident that the share of wealth held by the top 1 percent has increased over the years, with the most recent data indicating a significant concentration of wealth among the top earners.
