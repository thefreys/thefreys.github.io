Unfortunately, data on wealth distribution in the United States isn't readily available on a year-by-year basis before 1989. Resources like the Federal Reserve and Congressional Budget Office provide data starting from that period onwards [1, 2].

Here are some resources that can help you understand wealth distribution trends in the US:

* **Congressional Budget Office: Trends in the Distribution of Family Wealth, 1989 to 2019** ([https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57598](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57598))
* **USAFacts: How has wealth distribution in the US changed over time?** ([https://usafacts.org/](https://usafacts.org/))
* **Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: A Guide to Statistics on Historical Trends in Income Inequality** ([https://www.cbpp.org/research/topics/poverty-and-inequality](https://www.cbpp.org/research/topics/poverty-and-inequality))

These resources show a clear trend of increasing wealth concentration in the top 1% over the past few decades.
