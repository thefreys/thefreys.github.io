I do not have enough information to answer this question. The search results provided only include data starting from 1975.

After query amended to "How much of the United States wealth been held by the top 1 percent each year since 1975?":
-------------------------------------------------

According to the provided text, the share of wealth held by the top 1% in the United States has increased since 1975. In 1989, the top 1% held just under 30% of the wealth, and by 2016, this had increased to about 39%. The data also shows a long-term decline in wealth concentration from the 1920s to the 1970s, followed by a marked increase since then.
