According to the search results, the share of total wealth held by the top 1 percent of U.S. households has increased significantly since the 1950s:

- In 1978, the top 1 percent held less than 25% of total U.S. wealth.[1]
- By 2012, the top 1 percent's share of total wealth had increased to 42%.[1] 
- Estimates from various sources show the share of wealth held by the top 1 percent increased by around 7-8 percentage points from 1989 to 2019, rising from around 26-27% to 34-35%.[2][3]

The search results indicate that wealth concentration at the very top, particularly the top 0.1% and 0.01%, has increased even more dramatically over this period. The top 0.01% saw their share of total wealth more than quintuple from the 1950s to 2012.[1] Overall, the data shows a significant rise in wealth inequality, with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top of the distribution since the 1950s.[1][2][3]
