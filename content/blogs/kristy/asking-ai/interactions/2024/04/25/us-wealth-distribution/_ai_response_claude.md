Here are some key facts about the concentration of wealth held by the top 1% in the United States since 1950:

- In the early 1950s, the wealthiest 1% of Americans owned around 25-30% of the nation's total household wealth.

- This share declined over the next few decades, hitting a low of around 22% in the late 1970s.

- Since then, wealth inequality has risen substantially. The top 1%'s share of total household wealth climbed to around 39% by the late 2010s.

- The rising trend has continued. Estimates suggest the top 1% held over 35% of household wealth in 2022, near its highest levels since the 1930s.

- More specifically, data from the Federal Reserve shows the top 1% held around 26-27% of wealth in the early 1990s. This increased to 34% by 2007, dipped slightly after the Great Recession, but then continued rising to around 38% by 2019.

- For comparison, the bottom 50% of households held just 2% of total wealth in 2019, illustrating the stark divide.

So in summary, while the wealth share of the top 1% hovered around 25-30% in the mid-20th century, it has climbed significantly over recent decades, approaching 40% of total U.S. household wealth by the early 2020s.
