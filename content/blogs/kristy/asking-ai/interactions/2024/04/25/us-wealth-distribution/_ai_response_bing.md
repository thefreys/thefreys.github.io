The distribution of wealth in the United States has seen significant changes since 1950, with the top 1% of earners increasing their share over time. While I don't have the exact year-by-year data since 1950, I can provide some key points from recent decades:

- In **1990**, the top 1% held about **17%** of the nation's wealth.
- By the end of **2022**, this figure had grown to **26%**, marking a **nine percentage point** increase over 32 yearsÂ¹[1].

It's important to note that wealth distribution is a complex and evolving topic, influenced by various economic and policy factors. For a detailed year-by-year analysis, you might want to look at historical data from sources like the Federal Reserve or scholarly research on the topic. If you're interested in more recent trends or specific details, I can look up more information for you.
