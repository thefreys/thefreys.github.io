Estimating the exact percentage of wealth held by the top 1 percent in the United States annually since 1950 would require specific data analysis from reputable sources such as the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Census Bureau, or academic studies. Typically, this information is derived from wealth distribution studies and economic surveys. Over the decades, this percentage has fluctuated due to various factors such as changes in economic policies, taxation, market trends, and societal shifts.

However, it's worth noting that there's been a general trend of increasing wealth concentration among the top percentile in recent decades, according to many analyses. This trend has sparked debates about income inequality and economic fairness. If you're interested in recent estimates or trends, I can look up the most current information available.
