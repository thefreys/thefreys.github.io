#### Using DataTables to Default the Table to Show Rows Matching a Custom Filter Condition

To default the table to only show a set of rows which match a custom filter condition using DataTables, you can utilize the column().search() method to apply individual column searches and the draw() method to redraw the table when the filter condition changes.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. **Apply Individual Column Searches:**
   - Use the column().search() method to apply a specific filter to a column. This method allows you to search for specific values within a column, effectively filtering the table based on the specified condition.

2. **Redraw the Table:**
   - After applying the individual column searches, use the draw() method to redraw the table, reflecting the updated filter condition.

By combining these two methods, you can default the table to only show rows that match a custom filter condition.
