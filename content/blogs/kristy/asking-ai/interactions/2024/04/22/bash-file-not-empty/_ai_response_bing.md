To test if a file is not empty in Bash, you can use the `-s` flag within a conditional statement. This flag checks if the file exists and has a size greater than zero. Here's a simple script that demonstrates how to do this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Path to the file you want to check
file="path/to/your/file.txt"

# Check if the file is not empty
if [ -s "$file" ]; then
    echo "The file is not empty."
else
    echo "The file is empty or does not exist."
fi
```

This script will print "The file is not empty." if the file exists and its size is greater than zero. Otherwise, it will print "The file is empty or does not exist." Remember to replace `path/to/your/file.txt` with the actual path to your file.
