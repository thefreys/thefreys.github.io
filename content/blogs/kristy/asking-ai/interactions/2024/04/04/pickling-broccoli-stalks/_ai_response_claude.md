Here is a recipe for pickling broccoli stalks:

Ingredients:
- 1 lb broccoli stalks, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 cup white vinegar
- 1 cup water
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tbsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp mustard seeds
- 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- 2 garlic cloves, peeled
- 1 bay leaf

Instructions:

1. Prepare the broccoli stalks by removing the tough outer layer and cutting into 1-inch pieces. Pack the stalk pieces into a pint jar or heat-proof container.

2. In a saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, sugar, salt, mustard seeds, red pepper flakes, garlic cloves and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar and salt. 

3. Once boiling, carefully pour the hot vinegar mixture over the broccoli stalks in the jar, ensuring they are fully submerged. Leave 1/2 inch headspace at the top.

4. Tap the jar gently on the counter to remove any air bubbles. Seal the jar.

5. Allow the pickled broccoli stalks to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 24 hours before eating to allow the flavors to develop.

6. The pickles will keep refrigerated for up to 2 months. For best flavor, consume within 4-6 weeks.
