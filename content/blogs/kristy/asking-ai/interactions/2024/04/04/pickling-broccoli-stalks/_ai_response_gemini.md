There are a few ways to pickle broccoli stalks, depending on your desired flavor and level of effort. Here are two options:

**Quick Refrigerator Pickles:**

This is a simple recipe that results in tangy, slightly crisp pickles in just a few days.

    * Rice vinegar (â…“ cup)
    * Water (enough to fill jar)
    * Sugar (1 tablespoon)
    * Salt (1 teaspoon)
    * Garlic clove (minced)

* **Instructions:**
    1. Slice broccoli stalks thinly (you can use a mandoline or food processor for ease).
    2. Place them in a clean jar.
    3. In a saucepan, combine vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and garlic clove. Bring to a boil and stir until sugar dissolves.
    4. Pour the hot pickling liquid over the broccoli stalks in the jar.
    5. Let the pickles cool completely, then store them in the refrigerator for at least 2 weeks before enjoying.

**Spicy Pickled Broccoli Stems:**

This recipe involves a pickling brine and takes a little longer, but offers a more flavorful and crunchy pickle.

* **Ingredients:**
    * Broccoli stalks (1.2 kg)
    * White vinegar (1.1 L)
    * Water (600 ml)
    * Salt (60 g)
    * Sugar (220 g)
    * Garlic cloves (8)
    * Red pepper flakes (3 g)
    * Bay leaves (4)
    * Pickling spice (12 g) (optional)

* **Instructions:**
    1. Cut broccoli stalks into bite-sized pieces.
    2. In a large pot, combine vinegar, water, salt, sugar, pepper flakes, bay leaves, and pickling spice (if using). Bring to a boil.
    3. Place broccoli stalks and garlic cloves in a sterilized jar.
    4. Pour the hot pickling liquid over the broccoli, ensuring everything is submerged.
    5. Seal the jar tightly and let it cool completely at room temperature.
    6. Refrigerate for at least 3 days before enjoying. The pickles will continue to develop flavor over time and will last up to 4 weeks in the fridge.

These are just two ideas to get you started. You can experiment with different flavors by adding other herbs, spices, or chilies to the pickling liquid.
