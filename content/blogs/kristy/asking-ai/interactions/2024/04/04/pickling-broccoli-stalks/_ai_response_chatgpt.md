Sure, pickled broccoli stalks can be a delicious addition to your pantry. Here's a simple recipe:

**Ingredients:**
- 1 to 1.5 pounds of broccoli stalks (make sure they're fresh and firm)
- 2 cups white vinegar
- 2 cups water
- 2 tablespoons salt
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
- 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
- 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
- Optional: red pepper flakes for heat
- Sterilized glass jars with lids

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the broccoli stalks:** Wash the broccoli stalks thoroughly and trim off any tough or woody parts. Peel the outer layer of the stalks if they are tough, then cut them into bite-sized pieces or spears.

2. **Prepare the brine:** In a saucepan, combine the white vinegar, water, salt, and sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the salt and sugar are fully dissolved. Remove the brine from heat and let it cool slightly.

3. **Prepare the jars:** While the brine is cooling, pack the broccoli stalks into sterilized glass jars, leaving some headspace at the top. Add the crushed garlic, black peppercorns, mustard seeds, coriander seeds, and red pepper flakes (if using) to the jars.

4. **Fill the jars:** Pour the slightly cooled brine over the broccoli stalks, covering them completely and leaving about 1/2 inch of headspace at the top of the jars. Tap the jars gently to remove any air bubbles.

5. **Seal the jars:** Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean, damp cloth to remove any spills. Place the lids on the jars and tighten them securely.

6. **Process (optional):** If you want to store the pickled broccoli stalks for a longer period at room temperature, you can process the jars in a boiling water bath. Place the filled jars in a large pot of boiling water, making sure they're fully submerged. Process for about 10-15 minutes, then carefully remove the jars and let them cool on a kitchen towel.

7. **Storage:** Once the jars are cool, store them in the refrigerator. Allow the flavors to meld for at least a few days before opening the jars and enjoying your pickled broccoli stalks. They should last in the refrigerator for several weeks, if not longer.

Enjoy your homemade pickled broccoli stalks as a tasty snack, salad topping, or side dish!
