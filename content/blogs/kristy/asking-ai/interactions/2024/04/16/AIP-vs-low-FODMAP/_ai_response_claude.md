The main difference between AIP (Autoimmune Protocol) and low FODMAP diets is their intended purpose and the specific food groups they target.

AIP Diet:
- The AIP diet is designed to help manage autoimmune diseases by reducing inflammation and supporting gut health.
- It eliminates a wide range of foods, including grains, legumes, dairy, nightshade vegetables, eggs, nuts, seeds, and processed foods.
- The goal of AIP is to identify and remove foods that may be triggering or exacerbating the autoimmune response.
- After an initial elimination phase, the AIP diet gradually reintroduces certain foods to identify personal sensitivities.

Low FODMAP Diet:
- The low FODMAP diet is primarily used to manage digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
- It focuses on reducing intake of specific types of carbohydrates (FODMAPs) that can be poorly absorbed and cause gastrointestinal symptoms.
- The FODMAP groups include fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols.
- The low FODMAP diet temporarily eliminates high-FODMAP foods, then gradually reintroduces them to identify personal tolerances.

In summary, the AIP diet is focused on managing autoimmune conditions, while the low FODMAP diet is targeted toward managing digestive disorders like IBS. The food restrictions in each diet differ, although there may be some overlap in the eliminated foods.
