#### Difference Between AIP and Low FODMAP

The **low FODMAP diet** and the **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet** are both dietary approaches aimed at managing digestive issues, but they have several key differences.

The low FODMAP diet focuses on the restriction of certain compounds found in foods, specifically fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. This diet is well-known and proven to help those with irritable bowel syndrome reduce symptoms by eliminating or minimizing these compounds from the diet.

On the other hand, the AIP diet is a dietary and lifestyle approach that seeks to reduce inflammation and reverse autoimmunity through the elimination of certain foods. It is designed to help those dealing with autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Lupus, among others.

While the low FODMAP diet is primarily focused on managing digestive symptoms caused by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other digestive issues, the AIP diet is specifically aimed at addressing autoimmune diseases and reducing inflammation.

In summary, the low FODMAP diet targets specific compounds in foods to alleviate digestive symptoms, while the AIP diet is focused on reducing inflammation and addressing autoimmune diseases.
