As someone who has experienced digestive and autoimmune issues throughout their life, I make an effort to stay informed about the latest ideas regarding how diet impacts these conditions. I have a strong aversion to diets, and I firmly believe that many of us have been negatively affected by diet culture in some way. Please consider this perspective while using any information regarding diets.
