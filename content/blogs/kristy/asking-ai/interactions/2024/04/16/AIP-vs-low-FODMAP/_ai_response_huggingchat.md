The Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet and the low FODMAP diet are both elimination diets that can help manage digestive issues and improve symptoms such as bloating, gas, and constipation. However, they have some key differences:

- The AIP diet focuses on reducing inflammation by eliminating foods that are commonly known to trigger immune responses, while the low FODMAP diet targets specific carbohydrates that can be difficult to digest for people with sensitive guts.
- The AIP diet eliminates grains entirely, while the low FODMAP diet allows some grains in limited quantities.
- The AIP and low FODMAP diets have different allowances for vegetables, herbs, fruits, and nuts. The AIP diet, for example, restricts nightshade vegetables, while the low FODMAP diet may allow some of these in limited amounts.
- The AIP diet is more restrictive overall and can be challenging to follow, while the low FODMAP diet is a bit more flexible and may be easier to adhere to in the long term.
- The AIP diet is often recommended for people with autoimmune conditions, while the low FODMAP diet is specifically designed for those with irritable bowel syndrome and other functional gastrointestinal disorders.

In summary, both diets aim to reduce digestive symptoms and improve gut health, but they approach this goal in different ways and have distinct food restrictions. It may be beneficial to work with a healthcare provider or nutritionist to determine which diet is a better fit for your individual needs and health goals.
