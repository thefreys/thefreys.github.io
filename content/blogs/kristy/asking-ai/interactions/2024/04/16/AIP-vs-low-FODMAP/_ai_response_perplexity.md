The key differences between the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet and the low-FODMAP diet are:

1. Purpose:
- AIP is a comprehensive diet designed to reduce inflammation and heal the gut in people with autoimmune conditions. [2][3]
- Low-FODMAP is specifically targeted at reducing gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating, gas, and diarrhea by restricting certain carbohydrates. [1][2][4]

2. Allowed foods:
- AIP eliminates a wider range of foods including grains, legumes, nightshades, eggs, and nuts, in addition to high-FODMAP foods. [3]
- Low-FODMAP allows some foods that are restricted on AIP, like eggs, nuts, and some nightshades, as long as they are low in FODMAPs. [1][2][5]

3. Reintroduction:
- AIP has a structured reintroduction process to systematically test tolerance of eliminated foods. [3]
- Low-FODMAP focuses more on identifying and limiting specific high-FODMAP foods that cause symptoms, rather than a full reintroduction. [2][4]

4. Underlying causes:
- AIP aims to address the root causes of autoimmune disease, while low-FODMAP primarily targets digestive issues like IBS, SIBO, and fructose malabsorption. [2][3][4]

In summary, while there is some overlap, the AIP diet is a more comprehensive approach to autoimmune conditions, while low-FODMAP is specifically targeted at managing gastrointestinal symptoms. Many people with autoimmune diseases find benefit in combining the two approaches. [2][3]
