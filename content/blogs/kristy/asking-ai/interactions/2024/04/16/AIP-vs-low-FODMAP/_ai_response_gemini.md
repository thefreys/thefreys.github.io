AIP (Autoimmune Protocol) and Low FODMAP are two elimination diets that target different gut issues:

* **Target Audience:**
    * **AIP:** Designed for people with autoimmune diseases like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It aims to identify and eliminate foods that trigger the immune system.
    * **Low FODMAP:** Focuses on managing digestive problems in people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). It eliminates foods high in FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols), which can be difficult to digest and cause symptoms.

* **Level of Restriction:**
    * **AIP:** More restrictive. Eliminates grains, legumes, dairy, eggs, nuts, seeds, nightshade vegetables (like peppers, eggplant, potato), alcohol, processed foods, and refined sugar. Focuses on whole, unprocessed foods like meat, fish, vegetables (except nightshades), fruits (limited), bone broth, and herbal teas.
    * **Low FODMAP:** Less restrictive. Eliminates high-FODMAP foods initially, then reintroduces them in phases to identify triggers. Allows certain fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, and dairy products that are low in FODMAPs.

* **Goal:**
    * **AIP:** Reduce inflammation throughout the body and identify food triggers for autoimmune responses. 
    * **Low FODMAP:** Improve digestive symptoms like bloating, gas, constipation, and diarrhea.

**In Short:**

* AIP has a broader focus on managing autoimmune conditions through dietary changes.
* Low FODMAP targets specific gut issues caused by difficulty digesting certain carbohydrates.

If you're unsure which diet might be right for you, consulting a doctor or registered dietitian is recommended. They can help you assess your specific needs and choose the most appropriate approach.
