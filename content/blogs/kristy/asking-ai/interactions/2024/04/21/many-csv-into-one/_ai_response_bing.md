To search a directory recursively for files named `myFile.csv` and concatenate them into one file using Bash, you can use the `find` command combined with `cat`. Here's a command that does just that:

```bash
find /path/to/search -type f -name 'myFile.csv' -exec cat {} + > concatenated.csv
```

This command will:
- Start the search within `/path/to/search`. Replace this with the actual path where you want to start your search.
- Look for files (`-type f`) with the name `myFile.csv`.
- Execute the `cat` command on the found files to concatenate their contents.
- Redirect the output into a file named `concatenated.csv`.

Make sure to run this command in the directory where you want the `concatenated.csv` file to be created, or provide an absolute path for the output file.
