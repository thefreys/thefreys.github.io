#### Searching and Concatenating CSV Files in Bash

To search a directory recursively for files named myFile.csv and concatenate them into one file in Bash, you can use the following approach:

1. **Search for CSV Files Recursively:**
   - Use the `find` command to search for all files named myFile.csv within the directory and its subdirectories.
   - The command would look like this:
     ```
     find /path/to/search -type f -name 'myFile.csv'
     ```

2. **Concatenate the Files:**
   - Once you have the list of files, you can use the `cat` command to concatenate them into one file.
   - The command to concatenate the files would be:
     ```
     cat /path/to/search/*myFile.csv > concatenatedFile.csv
     ```

By using these commands, you can recursively search for files named myFile.csv and concatenate them into one file named concatenatedFile.csv.

This approach allows you to efficiently search for and concatenate the specified CSV files in the given directory and its subdirectories.
