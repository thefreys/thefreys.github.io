Here's how you can search a directory recursively for files named "myFile.csv" and concatenate them into one file using bash:

```bash
find . -type f -name "myFile.csv" | xargs cat > combined_myfile.csv
```

**Explanation:**

* `find .`: This searches the current directory (represented by ".") and all its subdirectories recursively.
* `-type f`: This filters the search results to only include files (not directories).
* `-name "myFile.csv"`: This specifies the filename pattern to search for, which is "myFile.csv" in this case.
* `|`: This pipe symbol sends the list of filenames found by `find` to the next command.
* `xargs cat`: The `xargs` command takes the list of filenames from `find` and executes the `cat` command for each file. 
    * `cat`: This command concatenates the content of each file. 
* `> combined_myfile.csv`: This redirects the output of `cat` (combined content of all files) to a new file named "combined_myfile.csv".

**Important notes:**

* This script will overwrite any existing file named "combined_myfile.csv".
* If some "myFile.csv" files have headers, you might want to consider adding a delimiter (e.g., a blank line) between each file content for better readability.

Here are some alternative approaches for handling headers:

1. **Skip headers:** If all "myFile.csv" files have the same header on the first line, you can use `tail` instead of `cat` to skip the first line of each file:

```bash
find . -type f -name "myFile.csv" | xargs tail -n +2 > combined_myfile.csv
```

2. **Add a delimiter:** Use a loop with `cat` and `echo` to insert a blank line between each file content:

```bash
combined_file="combined_myfile.csv"
for file in $(find . -type f -name "myFile.csv"); do
  cat "$file" >> "$combined_file"
  echo "" >> "$combined_file"
done
```

Choose the approach that best suits your specific needs based on the structure of your CSV files.
