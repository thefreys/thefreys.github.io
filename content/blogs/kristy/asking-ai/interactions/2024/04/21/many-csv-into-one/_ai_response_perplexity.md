Here is how you can search a directory recursively for files named "myFile.csv" and concatenate them into one file:

```
find . -type f -name "myFile.csv" -exec cat {} \; > combined_myFile.csv
```

Let's break down the command:

- `find . -type f -name "myFile.csv"`: This searches the current directory (`.`) recursively for regular files (`-type f`) with the name "myFile.csv".
- `-exec cat {} \;`: This executes the `cat` command on each of the matching files, concatenating their contents.
- `> combined_myFile.csv`: The output of the `cat` commands is redirected into a new file called "combined_myFile.csv".

The key steps are:

1. Use `find` to locate all the matching files.
2. Use `-exec` to run `cat` on each file and concatenate the contents.
3. Redirect the combined output to a new file.

This will create a single file "combined_myFile.csv" that contains the contents of all the individual "myFile.csv" files found in the directory structure. [1][2][3][4][5]
