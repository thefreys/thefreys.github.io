Certainly! To remove the extension from a filename variable in **Bash**, you can use parameter expansion. Here are a couple of ways to achieve this:

1. **Using Parameter Expansion**:
   ```bash
   filename="file.txt"
   no_extension="${filename%.*}"
   echo "The file name without the extension is: $no_extension"
   ```
   This will output:
   > The file name without the extension is: file

   If you have a file path and not just a file name, you can use `basename` first to get just the filename including the extension. For example:
   ```bash
   filepath="path.to/foo.txt"
   filename=$(basename "$filepath")
   echo "${filename%.*}"
   ```
   This will correctly handle cases where there are dots in the path or multiple extensionsÂ¹Â².

2. **Using `basename`**:
   If you always know the extension you want to remove, you can directly use `basename`:
   ```bash
   basename /home/jsmith/base.wiki .wiki
   ```
   This will give you `/home/jsmith/base` as the result.

Remember to adjust the commands based on your specific use case! ðŸŒŸ
