I asked the AI chatbots to give me JavaScript libraries for working with the HTML5 canvas element which are similar to fabric.js and put them in a table for comparison.

These libraries offer various features and capabilities, such as working with vector graphics, raster images, animations, interactions, and rendering on different contexts like Canvas, SVG, or WebGL.
