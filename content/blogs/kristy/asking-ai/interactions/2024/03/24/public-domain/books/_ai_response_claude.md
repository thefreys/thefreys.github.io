There are several places where public domain books and media files can be found hosted online:

1. Project Gutenberg (www.gutenberg.org) - One of the oldest and largest collections of free public domain ebooks. They have over 60,000 free ebooks available for download.

2. Internet Archive (www.archive.org) - In addition to the Wayback Machine of archived websites, Internet Archive hosts a huge library of free books, movies, software, music and more that are in the public domain.

3. Google Books (books.google.com) - Google has scanned millions of books, including many out-of-copyright works that are available to read for free.

4. LibriVox (www.librivox.org) - A collection of free public domain audiobooks that are recorded by volunteers.

5. Wikimedia Commons (commons.wikimedia.org) - The media repository of Wikimedia hosts millions of free-use images, sounds, videos and general media files that are in the public domain or licensed for re-use.

6. Certain university and public library websites also host digitized collections of older, public domain materials from their special collections.

Many of these sites allow downloading the files directly or provide reader applications to view the content online in a browser. They operate by only hosting works that have entered the public domain due to their age or other circumstances.
