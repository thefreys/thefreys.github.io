Yes, there are several JavaScript libraries available for video editing and manipulation. Here are some popular ones:

1. **FFmpeg.js**: This is a pure JavaScript port of FFmpeg, a powerful multimedia library for transcoding, streaming, and processing audio/video files. It allows you to perform various video editing operations like trimming, concatenating, adding filters, and more directly in the browser.

2. **Whammy.js**: A lightweight library that encodes JavaScript objects into animation data, allowing you to generate animated GIF files directly from JavaScript objects or canvas contexts.

3. **VideoContext**: A JavaScript library that provides a renderer and a compositing engine to manipulate video and canvas sources in real-time, enabling features like video transitions, effects, and compositing.

4. **Popcorn.js**: A former HTML5 media framework that allowed you to create web experiences by synchronizing videos with other web content like text, maps, and more. It's not actively maintained anymore, but some developers still use it.

5. **Remotion**: A React-based library specifically designed for creating videos programmatically. It leverages the power of React to render videos by defining components that represent different scenes or elements within the video.

6. **Video.js**: While Video.js is primarily a video player library, it provides some basic editing capabilities like trimming and adding overlays or watermarks to videos.

It's worth noting that some of these libraries might have limitations or performance issues when dealing with complex video editing tasks, especially on the client-side (browser). For more advanced video editing requirements, server-side solutions or native applications might be more suitable.
