Inflammation is a natural process that occurs when the body's immune system responds to an illness, injury, or foreign substance. It is the body's way of protecting itself and initiating the healing process. However, inflammation can become harmful when it persists for too long or occurs in healthy tissues.

Treatment for inflammation aims to reduce discomfort and address the underlying cause. Acute inflammation often resolves within a few days and can be managed through rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE protocol). Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, such as NSAIDs, can also help reduce pain and swelling. 

For chronic inflammation or inflammatory diseases like arthritis, treatment may include a combination of medications, rest, exercise, and surgery to correct joint damage. An anti-inflammatory diet, including fatty fish, fresh fruits, leafy greens, and certain spices like turmeric, can also help reduce and prevent inflammation. Additionally, managing stress and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are important components of inflammation treatment.
