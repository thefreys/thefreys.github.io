Inflammation is a protective response of your body's tissues to harmful stimuli such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. It's a complex biological process involving your immune system, where various cells and proteins work together to eliminate the threat and begin the healing process¹².

There are two main types of inflammation:
- **Acute inflammation**: This is a short-term response with effects that may last for a few hours to a few days. It's characterized by redness, pain, heat, and swelling at the affected site².
- **Chronic inflammation**: This is a long-term response that can last for months or years. It may result from persistent irritants or diseases and can lead to various chronic conditions².

Treatment for inflammation includes:
- **Self-care**: Steps such as stopping smoking, avoiding alcohol, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, and adopting an anti-inflammatory diet with foods like olive oil, high-fiber foods, fruits, leafy greens, and fatty fish¹.
- **Medication**: Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs, prescription medications, and in some cases, steroids.
- **Medical attention**: It's important to see a doctor if you notice symptoms that need attention, such as fever, joint pain, or rashes. Immediate medical attention is required for severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) or symptoms of sepsis¹.

Specialists involved in the treatment of inflammation-related conditions include primary care physicians, infectious disease specialists, rheumatologists, and emergency medicine specialists, depending on the underlying cause and severity¹.
