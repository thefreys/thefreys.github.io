#### FODMAP-Free Foods

When following a low FODMAP diet, it's important to identify foods that are free of FODMAPs and can be consumed without triggering symptoms. Here are some foods that are considered FODMAP-free or have no detectable FODMAPs:

1. **Protein Foods**: Meats, poultry, and fish are naturally free of FODMAPs. However, processed and marinated meats may contain FODMAPs due to the addition of high FODMAP ingredients such as garlic and onion

    .
2. **Plant-Based Milk Alternatives**: Many plant-based milk alternatives are low in FODMAPs, such as soy milk (made from soy protein), almond milk, and rice milk. It's important to choose calcium-fortified varieties to ensure an adequate calcium intake

3. **Fats**: Fats contain no carbohydrates, or a small enough amount, to be labeled as not containing FODMAPs. However, it's essential to consider serving sizes and portions, as they might not be completely free of FODMAPs in certain quantities

4. **Seafood**: Fresh fish and seafood (ensuring nothing else is added) are considered FODMAP-free.
5. **Sugar-Free Fizzy Drinks**: Sugar-free fizzy drinks, soft drinks, or soda, such as diet coke, can be consumed in low quantities as aspartame and acesulfame K can be irritants. It's important to be mindful of portion sizes and individual tolerance

It's important to note that individual tolerance to these foods can vary, and it's advisable to work with a dietitian and keep a food diary to tailor an individual low FODMAP food list based on personal symptoms
