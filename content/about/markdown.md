<h1>About</h1>

This simple website displays content maintained separate from code. Each content item (node) is represented by a directory and a few key files within it. Content is primarily written in markdown to facilitate quick creation without needing to know HTML. For more information on what files go into a node, see the [README.md](https://github.com/thefreys/thefreys.github.io/blob/main/content/README.md) in the [content directory](https://github.com/thefreys/thefreys.github.io/blob/main/content) of the github repository.

[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [Bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)), and the [marked](https://marked.js.org/) library are a few of the frontend technologies used to create the interactive single page site with navigation menus and a sitemap without the need for a backend server language. Even in the absence of a web server, the content is still easily consumable due the native readability of markdown and the organization of files into a meaningful directory structure.
