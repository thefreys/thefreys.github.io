# Mashed potatoes

## Equipment
- Vegetable peeler
- Medium chef's knife or paring knife
- Cutting board
- 6+ quart pot
- Strainer/colander
- Potato masher (**potato ricer** is preferred)
- Large spoon
- 4-cup PYREX measuring cup or a microwave-safe bowl

## Ingredients

5 pounds **yellow** or **red potatoes**
8 ounces (1 stick) **unsalted butter**
1 1/2 cups **milk**, any kind
1 tablespoon **table salt**
1/3 cup **mayonnsaise**
 
## Directions

 1. Peel and cut potatoes in to about 1 inch sections, try to keep the slices about the same size for even cooking
 2. Add all sliced potatoes to the pot, fill pot with water until the potatoes are covered by about one inch of water
 3. Cook potatoes on high heat for about a half-hour
	 Test for doneness with a fork - if the tines of a fork slide through the potato with very little resistance, they're done
 4.  Drain potatoes in to colander, rinse the cooking pot as we'll mash the potatoes in it
 5. Add milk, butter and salt to measuring cup or microwave-safe bowl, microwave for about 4 minutes on high or until butter has melted
 6. Rice or mash potatoes in pot, add milk/butter/salt mixture, stir thoroughly to combine
 7. Stir in mayonnaise

## Notes
 - This recipe works best with a potato ricer
 - More milk can be added for thinner potatoes
 - Sour cream can be substituted for mayo, or skipped altogether in favor of additional milk or butter
