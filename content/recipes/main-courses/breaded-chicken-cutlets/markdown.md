# Breaded Chicken Cutlets

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds chicken breast
- 1 egg
- 1 tbsp mayonnaise
- 1 tbsp mustard (NOT powdered)
- 2 tbsp flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 cups breadcrumbs
- peanut oil spray

## Instructions

### Prepare the breaded cutlets for the freezer

1. Prepare the chicken by slicing it into 1/4-1/2 inch thick cutlets.
2. Place the chicken into a 1 gallon bag or a 4 quart bowl.
3. Create the batter by mixing the egg, mayonnaise, mustard, flour, and salt.
4. Pour the batter over the chicken and massage in to cover all of the chicken surface.
5. Refridgerate the chicken in the batter for at least 30 minutes.
6. Press the cutlets into the breadcrumbs, flipping and pressing multiple times
7. Place breaded cutlets flat on parchment in a freezer safe container with parchment between each layer
8. Freeze the breaded cutlets and make sure to mark the container with baking instructions. At the very least, mark that these are RAW.

### Baking the breaded chicken cutlets

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F
2. Place FROZEN cutlets on a baking sheet and spray both sides with peanut oil.
3. Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden and crispy.

## Notes

- Use regular or panko breadcrumbs, whichever you prefer.
- You can bake these without freezing first, but they don't stay as juicy.
- You can bake with an air fryer at 380°F for 20 minutes but they tend to be drier.
- I like to buy a big pack of chicken breasts and create frozen breaded cutlets from the whole package, then take 4-5 out of the freezer at a time to bake as needed.
