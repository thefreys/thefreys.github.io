# Shepherd's Pie

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 1/2 lb ground beef or lamb
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 2 cloves minced garlic
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp tomato paste
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tsp chopped rosemary leaves
- 1 tsp chopped thyme leaves
- 1/2 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels
- 1/2 cup fresh or frozen peas
- 2 cups mashed potatoes

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. Add vegetable oil to a large saute pan set over medium high heat. Once the oil shimmers, add the onion and carrots and saute just until they begin to take on color, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and stir to combine. 
3. Add the lamb, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes. Sprinkle the meat with the flour and toss to coat, continuing to cook for another minute. 
4. Add the tomato paste, chicken broth, Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 10 to 12 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly.
5. Add the corn and peas to the meat mixture and spread evenly into an 11 by 7-inch glass baking dish. 
6. Top with the mashed potatoes, starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up and smooth with a rubber spatula. 
7. Place on a parchment lined half sheet pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 25 minutes or just until the potatoes begin to brown. Remove to a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.

## Notes

- Dried thyme and rosemary can be used, reduce to 1/4 tsp thyme and 1/2 tsp rosemary
