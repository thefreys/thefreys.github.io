# Buttermilk pancakes

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 tbsp sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 14 tsp salt
- 2 1/2 cups buttermilk
- 2 eggs
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and kosher salt together in a bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, combine buttermilk, eggs and melted butter. 
3. Add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture; mix until combined.  Do not over-mix, the batter should have some lumps.
4. Heat a pan over low heat, or an electric skillet to about 350 degrees.  If using a pan, add butter or oil to the pan to prevent sticking.
5. Add about 1/3 cup of batter to pan or skillet.  Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface and bottoms brown, about 2 to 4 minutes. Cook until the other sides are lightly browned.
