# One-Pot Macaroni and Cheese Recipe

## Ingredients

- 1 lb elbow macaroni (or any pasta of your choice)
- 1 lb American cheese, sliced or shredded
- 4 cups of water
- 3 cups milk
- 6 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 tsp salt

## Instructions

1. In a large pot, bring the butter,milk, water, and salt to a boil over medium-high heat, while stirring constantly to make sure it does not burn on the bottom.

2. Add the pasta to the boiling liquid, stirring constantly, until it's just al dente (usually about 8 minutes).

3. Reduce the heat to low or turn off the heat completely. Add the american cheese, 1-2 slices at a time to the pot with the pasta. Stir continuously until the cheese is completely melted and the sauce is creamy. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a bit more milk to reach your desired consistency.

4. Once everything is well combined and creamy, let it sit for a couple of minutes to thicken up slightly, then serve warm.
