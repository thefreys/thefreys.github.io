# Lemon Torta Caprese

## Ingredients

 - 3/4 cup unsalted butter
 - 6 oz white chocolate chips
 - 5 eggs, separated
 - 1/4 tsp salt
 - 2/3 cup granulated sugar
 - 1 1/2 cup almond flour
 - 1/4 cup lemon juice
 - 4 tsp lemon zest

## Instructions

  1.  Place the butter and chocolate in the top of a double boiler and melt until smooth. Cool slightly until just warm to the touch.
  2.  Preheat oven to 35o degrees
  3.  Butter the inside of a 9 inch springform pan
  4.  Place the egg whites in a medium bowl with the salt. Place the yolks in a slightly larger bowl with the sugar. Using a handheld mixer beat the whites on medium speed until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes.
  5.  Transfer the mixer to the yolk bowl and beat on medium speed until light, pale and fluffy, about 1 1/2 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, stir the chocolate mixture, almond flour, lemon juice and lemon zest into the yolks.
  6.  In 2 batches, fold the whipped whites into the chocolate base. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and bake for 45 minutes or until puffed, golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs.
  7.  Cool completely on a wire rack. When cool, run a thin knife around the edge of the pan to release the cake. Remove the outside ring and dust the top with confectioners sugar. Serve with soft whipped cream if desired.
