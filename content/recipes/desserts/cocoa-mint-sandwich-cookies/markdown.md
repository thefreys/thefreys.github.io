## Cookie Ingredients

- 3/4 cup butter
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 egg
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
- 2 cup flour
- 3/4 cup cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup milk

### Cookie Instructions

1. Cream butter and sugar until fluffy
2. Add egg & vanilla and beat well
3. Sift in dry ingredients adding alternately with milk
4. Chill dough for a few hours or overnight
5. Roll out dough on floured surface and cut into shapes (make sure to do multiples of 2 for sandwiches)
6. Bake on cookie sheets @ 325° for 10 min (do not grease the cookie sheets)

## Frosting Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted
- 1-2 tablespoons milk (start with 1, add more as needed)
- 1-2 drops of peppermint extract or to taste
- 1-2 drops green food coloring (optional)

### Frosting Instructions

1. Beat the softened butter until creamy, about 1-2 minutes.
2. Gradually add the powdered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, beating until combined. After each 1/2 cup, add a little milk to keep the mixture smooth. Beat well to ensure there are no lumps.
3. Add the mint extract and a pinch of salt (if using) to the mixture. Beat to incorporate. 
4. If you're using food coloring, add a few drops at a time until you reach your desired shade of green.

### Assembly

When cookies are cool, put together sandwich style with the mint frosting or frost each one if you prefer not to make sandwiches
