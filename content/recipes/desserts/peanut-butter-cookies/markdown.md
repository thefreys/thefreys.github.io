# Peanut Butter Cookies

## Ingredients:

- 10 tablespoons (140g) unsalted butter, brought to room temperature
- 1/2 cup (128g) peanut butter  
- 2/3 cup (150g) tightly packed light brown sugar
- 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar (1/4 cup/50g for mixing, 1/4 cup/50g for rolling)
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 teaspoon (4ml) vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups (190g) all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon (8g) cornstarch
- 3/4 teaspoon (4g) baking soda
- 3/4 teaspoon (4g) salt
- 1 cup (140g) peanut butter chips (optional)
- Additional granulated sugar for rolling

## Equipment:
- 1 1/2 tablespoon-sized cookie scoop
- Electric mixer
- Glass mixing bowls
- Spatulas

## Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine softened butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, and 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Beat until the mixture is creamy and thoroughly combined.
2. Add the egg and vanilla extract to the mixture, stirring until fully incorporated.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt.
4. Gradually add the flour mixture to the peanut butter mixture, ensuring thorough mixing. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.
5. Stir in peanut butter chips
6. Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the peanut butter cookie dough for 30 minutes to one hour. Optionally, you can chill the dough overnight for enhanced flavor.
7. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
8. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
9. Using a 1 1/2 tablespoon-sized cookie scoop, form heaping balls of chilled dough. Roll each ball between your palms until smooth, then coat them thoroughly in the remaining 1/4 cup of granulated sugar.
10. Place the coated dough balls on the prepared baking sheets, ensuring they are spaced at least 2 inches apart.
11. Use the tines of a fork to gently press down on each cookie, creating a crisscross pattern on the surface.
12. Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 9-12 minutes. The edges should just start to turn golden brown, while the centers may still appear slightly under-baked. Avoid over-baking to retain a soft and chewy texture.
13. Allow the cookies to cool completely on the baking sheets. As they cool, the centers will continue to bake, resulting in perfectly chewy cookies.
14. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious homemade peanut butter cookies!
