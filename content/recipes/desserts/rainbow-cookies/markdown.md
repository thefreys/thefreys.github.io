# Rainbow Cookies

## Ingredients

- 8 ounces almond paste
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 4 large eggs, separated
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Red, green, and yellow food coloring
- 1 cup apricot jam (seedless)
- 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line three 9x9-inch baking pans with parchment paper.
2. Grate the almond paste using a box grater. This helps it incorporate into the batter more easily.
3. In a large bowl, beat together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
4. Add the grated almond paste to the butter and sugar mixture. Beat until well combined.
5. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, ensuring each yolk is fully incorporated. Add almond extract and mix well.
6. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour and salt.
7. Gradually add the sifted dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
8. In another clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.
9. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter until no white streaks remain. Be careful not to deflate the egg whites.
10. Divide the batter into three equal portions. Add red food coloring to one portion, green to another, and leave the third portion plain.
11. Spread each colored batter into its prepared pan. Smooth the tops. Bake for about 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake.
12. Once the layers are baked and cooled, spread a layer of apricot jam on top of the plain layer. Place the green layer on top of the jam, followed by another layer of jam and then the red layer.
13. Place the assembled layers in the refrigerator to chill for a few hours or overnight. This makes it easier to cut.
14. In a microwave-safe bowl or using a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter until smooth.
15. Remove the chilled layers from the refrigerator and spread the melted chocolate mixture evenly over the top layer.
16. Place the cookies back in the refrigerator for the chocolate to set.
17. Once the chocolate is set, remove from the refrigerator and cut the layered stack into small squares.
