# Rainbow Cookies

## Ingredients:

- 8 ounces almond paste
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 4 large eggs, separated
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Red, green, and yellow food coloring
- 1 cup apricot jam (seedless)
- 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

## Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line three 9x9-inch baking pans with parchment paper.

2. **Prepare the Almond Paste:**
   Grate the almond paste using a box grater. This helps it incorporate into the batter more easily.

3. **Cream Butter and Sugar:**
   In a large bowl, beat together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.

4. **Add Almond Paste:**
   Add the grated almond paste to the butter and sugar mixture. Beat until well combined.

5. **Add Egg Yolks and Almond Extract:**
   Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, ensuring each yolk is fully incorporated. Add almond extract and mix well.

6. **Sift Dry Ingredients:**
   In a separate bowl, sift together the flour and salt.

7. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:**
   Gradually add the sifted dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.

8. **Beat Egg Whites:**
   In another clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.

9. **Fold in Egg Whites:**
   Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter until no white streaks remain. Be careful not to deflate the egg whites.

10. **Divide Batter and Add Food Coloring:**
    Divide the batter into three equal portions. Add red food coloring to one portion, green to another, and leave the third portion plain.

11. **Bake Layers:**
    Spread each colored batter into its prepared pan. Smooth the tops. Bake for about 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake.

12. **Assemble the Layers:**
    Once the layers are baked and cooled, spread a layer of apricot jam on top of the plain layer. Place the green layer on top of the jam, followed by another layer of jam and then the red layer.

13. **Chill:**
    Place the assembled layers in the refrigerator to chill for a few hours or overnight. This makes it easier to cut.

14. **Melt Chocolate:**
    In a microwave-safe bowl or using a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter until smooth.

15. **Spread Chocolate on Top:**
    Remove the chilled layers from the refrigerator and spread the melted chocolate mixture evenly over the top layer.

16. **Chill Again:**
    Place the cookies back in the refrigerator for the chocolate to set.

17. **Cut into Squares:**
    Once the chocolate is set, remove from the refrigerator and cut the layered stack into small squares.

18. **Serve:**
    Arrange the rainbow cookies on a serving platter and enjoy!
