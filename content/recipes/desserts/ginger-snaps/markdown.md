# Ginger Snaps

## Equipment:
- Stand mixer or hand mixer with a medium to large bowl
- Medium bowl for dry ingredients
- Small bowl for rolling dough in sugar
- Spatula
- Cookie sheets and parchment paper or Silpat mats
- Cooling racks

## Ingredients:
- 3/4 cup (170g) **vegetable shortening**
- 1 cup (200g) **white sugar**
- 1 **egg**
- 1/4 cup (60ml) **molasses**
- 2 cups (250g) **all-purpose flour**
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) **ground ginger**
- 1 teaspoon (5ml) **ground cinnamon**
- 1/2 teaspoon (2.5ml) **baking powder**
- 1 teaspoon (5ml) **baking soda**
- 1/2 teaspoon (2.5ml) **table salt**
- 1/3 cup (65g) **white sugar** for rolling

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a stand mixer or using a hand mixer with a medium to large bowl, cream together the vegetable shortening and white sugar until smooth. Add the egg and molasses, and beat until smooth.
3. In a separate medium bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, ground ginger, ground cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir until thoroughly combined.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the shortening mixture, mixing until fully combined.
5. Place the remaining 1/3 cup of granulated sugar in a shallow bowl.
6. Using a small scoop, form one-inch dough balls. Roll each dough ball in the granulated sugar, then place them on a parchment-lined cookie sheet, spacing them about 3 inches apart.
7. Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are slightly browned around the edges.
8. After removing the cookies from the oven, allow them to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to wire cooling racks to cool completely.

## Notes:
- You can fit 6 cookies on a smaller cookie sheet; avoid overcrowding.
- For chewier cookies, you can replace some or all of the shortening with butter.
- For puffier cookies, use 1 teaspoon of baking powder and omit the baking soda.
