# ChatGPT, Please give me a recipe for crab cakes using imitation crab

Certainly! Imitation crab, made from surimi (a processed seafood made of starch and finely pulverized white fish), is a great and affordable alternative for crab cakes. Here's a simple recipe for making crab cakes with imitation crab:

### Ingredients

- 2 cups of imitation crab meat, shredded
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce (optional)
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs or cracker crumbs
- 1/4 cup finely chopped green onions or chives
- 1/4 cup finely chopped bell pepper (optional)
- 1 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning (or any seafood seasoning)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil or butter, for frying

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Imitation Crab**: In a large bowl, shred the imitation crab meat into small, flaky pieces using your fingers or a fork.

2. **Mix Wet Ingredients**: Add the mayonnaise, egg, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce to the bowl. Mix these ingredients until well combined.

3. **Add Dry Ingredients**: Add the breadcrumbs, green onions, bell pepper (if using), and Old Bay seasoning to the mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir everything together until the mixture is well combined. If the mixture is too wet, you can add a bit more breadcrumbs.

4. **Form Crab Cakes**: Using your hands, form the mixture into small patties, about the size of a golf ball, then flatten them slightly.

5. **Chill (Optional)**: For best results, cover and chill the crab cakes in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. This step helps them hold together better when cooking.

6. **Cook the Crab Cakes**: Heat the oil or butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the crab cakes to the skillet (don't overcrowd the pan). Cook for about 3-5 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy.

7. **Serve**: Serve the crab cakes hot, with lemon wedges and your choice of dipping sauce, like tartar sauce or a remoulade.

Enjoy your imitation crab cakes as a delicious appetizer or main course!
