# Yeast Rolls

## Ingredients:

- 1 cup warm milk (110째F/43째C)
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions:

1. In a small bowl, combine warm milk and sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Sprinkle the yeast over the mixture, and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, softened butter, and salt. Pour in the yeast mixture and mix until a dough forms.

3. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.

4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.

5. Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C).

6. Punch down the risen dough, then divide it into equal-sized portions and shape them into rolls.

7. Place the rolls on a greased baking sheet, cover, and let them rise again for about 30 minutes.

8. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the rolls are golden brown.

9. Optional: Brush the tops of the rolls with melted butter after they come out of the oven for a shiny finish.
