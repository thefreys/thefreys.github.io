This simple website displays content maintained separate from code. Each content item (node) is represented by a directory and a few key files within it. Content is primarily written in markdown to facilitate quick creation without needing to know HTML. For more information on what files go into a node, see the [README.md](https://github.com/thefreys/thefreys.github.io/blob/main/content/README.md) in the [content directory](https://github.com/thefreys/thefreys.github.io/blob/main/content) of the github repository.

JavaScript, the Bootstrap framework, the showdown library are a few of the technologies used to create the interactive single page site with navigation menus and a sitemap you see here without the need for a backend server language. In the absence of a server, the content is still easily consumable due the native readability of a markdown and the organization of files into a meaningful directory structure.
