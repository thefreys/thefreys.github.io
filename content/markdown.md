This simple website uses JavaScript, the Bootstrap framework, and Markdown formatted content to build an interactive single page site with navigation menus and a sitemap without the need for a backend server language. 

- JavaScript is used to dynamically generate the page content and show/hide sections and menus when clicked' 
- Bootstrap provides responsive grid layouts and styled UI components out of the box
- Markdown text formatting allows writing the content using simple typographic conventions which are converted to HTML. 
 
Together these technologies allow rapidly creating a functional site with navigation menus and structured page areas, while avoiding complex HTML/CSS markup and keeping the focus on the content.
