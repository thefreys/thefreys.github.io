### One-Pot Macaroni and Cheese Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 1 lb elbow macaroni (or any pasta of your choice)
- 1 lb American cheese, sliced or shredded
- 4 cups of water 
- 3 cups milk
- 6 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 tsp salt

**Instructions:**
1. **Combine Butter, Milk, Water, and Salt **: In a large pot, bring the butter,milk, water, and salt to a boil over medium-high heat, while stirring constantly to make sure it does not burn on the bottom.

2. **Cook the Pasta**: Add the pasta to the boiling liquid, stirring constantly, until it's just al dente (usually about 8 minutes).

3. **Add Cheese**: Reduce the heat to low or turn off the heat completely. Add the american cheese, 1-2 slices at a time to the pot with the pasta. Stir continuously until the cheese is completely melted and the sauce is creamy. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a bit more milk to reach your desired consistency.

4. **Serve**: Once everything is well combined and creamy, let it sit for a couple of minutes to thicken up slightly, then serve warm.
