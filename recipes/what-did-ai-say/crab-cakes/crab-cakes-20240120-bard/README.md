2. Form the mixture into 6 equal patties.

3. Heat about 1/4 inch of canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

4. Add the crab cakes to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.

5. Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce, such as tartar sauce, remoulade, or aioli.

**Tips:**

* For a crispier crust, you can coat the crab cakes in additional breadcrumbs before frying.
* If you don't have panko breadcrumbs, you can use regular breadcrumbs.
* You can also bake the crab cakes instead of frying them. Preheat the oven to 400째F (200째C) and bake the crab cakes for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.

I hope you enjoy this recipe!

Here are some additional tips for making crab cakes with imitation crab:

* Use the freshest imitation crab meat you can find. It will make a big difference in the flavor of the crab cakes.
* Don't overmix the crab cake mixture. Overmixing will make the crab cakes tough.
* Be careful not to overcrowd the pan when frying the crab cakes. This will help them cook evenly.
* If you're not sure if the crab cakes are cooked through, you can insert a thermometer into the thickest part of a crab cake. It should reach an internal temperature of 160째F (71째C).

Enjoy your delicious homemade crab cakes!
