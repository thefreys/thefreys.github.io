Of course! Here's a basic recipe for a traditional pie crust:

Ingredients:
- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
- 2-4 tablespoons ice water

Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.
2. Add the chilled butter pieces to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter, two forks, or your fingers, cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of butter remaining.
3. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of ice water over the mixture and gently stir with a fork or spatula. Add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough begins to come together. Be careful not to overwork the dough.
4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times until it comes together into a smooth ball. Flatten the dough into a disk, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 days) before using.
5. Once chilled, remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes to slightly soften.
6. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter, depending on the size of your pie dish. Use the dough to line your pie dish, trimming any excess dough from the edges.
7. Fill the pie crust with your desired filling and bake according to your pie recipe's instructions.
