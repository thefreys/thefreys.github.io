## Equipment

- Stand mixer with paddle attachment
- Medium mixing bowl
- 9 inch round cake pan
- 9 inch round-cut parchment paper

## Ingredients

- 4 oz almond paste, broken in to small pieces
- 1/2 cup butter, softened
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
- 4 eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
- 1 1/3 cups almond flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup slivered almonds
- 2 tablespoon powdered sugar (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the bottom of the cake pan.  Grease the bottom and sides of the vake pan with butter or cooking spray.  Line the cake pan with the parchment paper, and grease the parchment paper.  
Dust the pam button and sides with flour and discard any excess.
2. Place the almond paste and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer, cream on medium speed until butter is light and fluffy and almond paste is fully incoroprated, about 3 minutes.
3. Add sugar and lemon zest, continue mixing until well combined.
4. Add eggs one at a time, stopping between each one to make sure that it is fully blended in.  Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl if necessary.  Add the almond extract and continue mixing until combined.
5. In a separate bowl, stir together the almond flour, baking powder and salt.
6. Add the flour mixture to the butter and egg mixture, mix on low speed until just completely combined.  Pour in to the prepared cake pan.
7. Sprinkle the almonds on the top of the batter, nake for 35 minutes or until a toothpick insered in the center of the cake comes out clean.
8. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool for 10-15 minutes.  The cake should pull away from the sides of the pan.  Remove the cake from the pan and place on a cooling rack.  When completely cool, optionally dust with powdered sugar.

## Notes

- Butter is preferred for greasing the cake pan, do not use shortening as it will leave a greasy residue on the cake
- This recipe is gluten-free if gluten-free flour or almond flour is used to dust the cake pan
- Orange zest can be substituted for lemon zest
