# Tiramisu

## Ingredients:

- 6 large egg yolks
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup mascarpone cheese, softened
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
- 2 cups strong brewed coffee, cooled
- 1/3 cup coffee liqueur (optional)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 24-30 ladyfinger cookies
- Cocoa powder, for dusting
- Dark chocolate shavings, for garnish (optional)

## Instructions:

1. In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method) and whisk constantly until the mixture thickens and becomes pale in color, about 8-10 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.

2. Add the softened mascarpone cheese to the egg yolk mixture and whisk until smooth and well combined.

3. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream and vanilla extract until soft peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until fully incorporated. Set aside.

4. In a shallow dish, combine the cooled brewed coffee and coffee liqueur (if using). Dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture briefly (don't soak them completely) and line them in the bottom of a 9x13-inch dish to create the first layer.

5. Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, smoothing it out evenly.

6. Create another layer of dipped ladyfingers on top of the mascarpone mixture.

7. Spread the remaining mascarpone mixture over the second layer of ladyfingers.

8. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate the tiramisu for at least 4 hours, or ideally overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.

9. Before serving, dust the top of the tiramisu with cocoa powder and garnish with chocolate shavings if desired.

10. Slice and serve chilled. Enjoy your homemade tiramisu!

Note: This recipe can be adjusted based on personal preferences, such as the amount of coffee used or the addition of alcohol. Also, tiramisu often tastes even better the day after it's made as the flavors have more time to meld together.
