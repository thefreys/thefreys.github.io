Here's a delicious recipe for crab cakes using imitation crab:

**Ingredients:**

* 12 ounces imitation crab meat, lump or claw meat preferred
* 1/2 cup mayonnaise
* 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs
* 1/4 cup finely chopped red bell pepper
* 1/4 cup finely chopped green onion
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 1 teaspoon lemon juice
* 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* Canola oil for frying

**Instructions:**

1. In a large bowl, combine the imitation crab meat, mayonnaise, panko breadcrumbs, red bell pepper, green onion, egg, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, Old Bay seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Mix gently until just combined.

2. Form the mixture into 6 equal patties.

3. Heat about 1/4 inch of canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

4. Add the crab cakes to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.

5. Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce, such as tartar sauce, remoulade, or aioli.

**Tips:**

* For a crispier crust, you can coat the crab cakes in additional breadcrumbs before frying.
* If you don't have panko breadcrumbs, you can use regular breadcrumbs.
* You can also bake the crab cakes instead of frying them. Preheat the oven to 400째F (200째C) and bake the crab cakes for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.

I hope you enjoy this recipe!

Here are some additional tips for making crab cakes with imitation crab:

* Use the freshest imitation crab meat you can find. It will make a big difference in the flavor of the crab cakes.
* Don't overmix the crab cake mixture. Overmixing will make the crab cakes tough.
* Be careful not to overcrowd the pan when frying the crab cakes. This will help them cook evenly.
* If you're not sure if the crab cakes are cooked through, you can insert a thermometer into the thickest part of a crab cake. It should reach an internal temperature of 160째F (71째C).

Enjoy your delicious homemade crab cakes!</div>
