They aim to swiftly address a searcher's query by providing a brief answer or summary. These snippets are automatically extracted from web pages indexed by Google and are displayed prominently to enhance user experience. Here are some key points about featured snippets:

1. **Appearance and Purpose**:
   - Featured snippets often appear **before** the regular search results, presenting relevant content directly.
   - They can be found within the main search results, in the "People also ask" section, or alongside Knowledge Graph information.
   - These snippets are especially helpful for mobile users and those searching by voice.

2. **Content Sources**:
   - Featured snippets are derived from **web search listings**.
   - Google's automated systems determine which page content would make a good featured snippet for a specific search query.

3. **Types of Featured Snippets**:
   - Common types include:
     - **Definitions**: Concise explanations of terms.
     - **Tables**: Organized data presented in a tabular format.
     - **Steps**: Sequential instructions or processes.
     - **Lists**: Enumerated points or items.

4. **Removal and Policies**:
   - Featured snippets are removed if they violate Google's policies.
   - Automated systems avoid showing snippets that don't adhere to policies.
   - User reports help improve search algorithms and prevent issues.
   - Websites with non-compliant snippets may lose eligibility for future features.

5. **Reporting a Featured Snippet**:
   - Users can report snippets that:
     - Don't follow policies.
     - Contain inaccurate or misleading information.
     - Provide answers users dislike.
   - Positive feedback also aids system improvement.

Remember, featured snippets are like a quick preview‚Äî**Position 0**‚Äîbefore diving into the full page content! üåüüîç
