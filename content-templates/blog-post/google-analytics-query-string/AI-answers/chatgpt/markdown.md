To track each value of a query string parameter as a different page in Google Analytics, you can use the feature called "Advanced Filters" to modify your page URLs so that each parameter value is tracked as a separate page. This involves creating a custom filter that appends the query string parameter to the URL path, allowing Google Analytics to record views of the same base page but with different parameters as separate page views. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Log in to Google Analytics**: Go to your Google Analytics account and select the view to which you want to apply the filter.

2. **Navigate to Filters**: In the Admin area of your account, you will find the "Filters" option under the "View" column.

3. **Add a New Filter**: Click on the "+ Add Filter" button to create a new filter.

4. **Configure the Filter**:
    - **Filter Name**: Give your filter a descriptive name, such as "Track Query Parameter as Page".
    - **Filter Type**: Choose "Custom" for the filter type.
    - **Advanced**: Select the "Advanced" option. This allows you to construct a Field A -> Extract A and Field B -> Extract B setup.
    - **Field A -> Extract A**: Choose "Request URI" from the dropdown menu. In the text box, enter a regular expression that captures your base URL path and the specific query string parameter you want to track. For example, to track the parameter `?id=123`, your regular expression might look like `^(.*?)(\?|&)id=([^&]*)(.*)$`.
    - **Output To -> Constructor**: Choose "Request URI" again. Here, you will construct the new URI you want to track, which includes the query parameter. Using the example above, you could use `$1?id=$3` to append the `id` parameter value to the URL path.

5. **Field A and Field B**: You might not need Field B for this operation unless you're combining or manipulating multiple parts of the URL.

6. **Save the Filter**: After configuring the filter, save your changes. It's important to note that filters in Google Analytics are not retroactive; they only affect data from the moment they are applied going forward.

7. **Verify the Filter**: Before or after saving, you can verify the filter (if this option is available) to see how it would affect your data based on existing data. This helps to ensure that the filter is set up correctly.

**Important Considerations**:
- **Test First**: It's a good practice to apply new filters to a test view first, to avoid corrupting your main data view with an incorrect filter.
- **Regular Expression**: The success of the filter depends on the accuracy of the regular expression used to match and rewrite the URL. Ensure your regular expression correctly captures the URL structure and query parameters of interest.
- **Data Integrity**: Keep in mind that this approach changes how page views are aggregated and could lead to a significant increase in the reported number of pages, potentially diluting metrics like pageviews per page.

This process allows you to segment page views more granularly based on the query string parameters, providing deeper insights into how different parameters influence user behavior on your site.
