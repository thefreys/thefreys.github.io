# Scammers Gonna Scam

It never fails, scammers and spammers will find a way to take advantage of everything. Today I noticed this absolute trash in the "Featured Snippet" when searching with Google. When you see garbage like this, report it using the Feedback link under the result. I did.

No UGURUS, I have no interesting in your services. 

I can't say if this is something deliberately being done by the result website itself or if advertisers have found a way to insert themselves into the Featured Snippet.  Either way, websites need to stop this nonsense or they will lose our trust.  Search engines need to take action as well.
