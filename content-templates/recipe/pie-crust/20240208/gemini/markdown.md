No matter which recipe you choose, remember to keep the ingredients cold and work the dough as little as possible to achieve a flaky crust. 

Here are some additional tips for making pie crust:

* Use all-purpose flour for the best results.
* Make sure your butter is very cold before cutting it into the flour. You can even freeze it for 30 minutes before using.
* Add the water a tablespoon at a time, stopping once the dough just comes together. Don't overmix!
* Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes before rolling it out. This will help it hold its shape and prevent shrinking in the oven.
* When rolling out the dough, use a light touch and avoid overworking it.
* If the dough tears, simply patch it up with your fingers. Don't worry about it being perfect!
