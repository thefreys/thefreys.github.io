The most common term for writing computer code is simply **coding**. It's a general term that encompasses the entire process of creating instructions for a computer to follow, from writing lines of code in a specific programming language to testing and debugging the program.

Other terms that are also used, but are less common than coding, include:

* **Programming:** This term emphasizes the specific task of creating instructions for a computer to follow, using a particular programming language.
* **Developing:** This term is often used when referring to the entire software development process, which includes coding, testing, debugging, and deploying the software.
* **Scripting:** This term is typically used when referring to writing short, simple programs, often in a scripting language like Python or JavaScript.

Ultimately, the best term to use depends on the context. But if you're looking for the most general and widely understood term, **coding** is the way to go.
