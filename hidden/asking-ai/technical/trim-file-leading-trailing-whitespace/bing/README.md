There are several ways to trim the contents of a file of leading and trailing whitespace in bash. One possible solution is to use the `sed` command with a regular expression that matches and removes the whitespace. For example, you can use the following command to trim the file `input.txt` and write the result to `output.txt`:

```bash
sed 's/^[[:blank:]]*//;s/[[:blank:]]*$//' input.txt > output.txt
```

This command uses two substitution patterns separated by a semicolon. The first pattern `s/^[[:blank:]]*//` removes any leading whitespace from the beginning of each line. The second pattern `s/[[:blank:]]*$//` removes any trailing whitespace from the end of each line. The `>` operator redirects the output of `sed` to a new file `output.txt`.

You can also use the `-i` option of `sed` to modify the file in-place, without creating a new file. For example:

```bash
sed -i 's/^[[:blank:]]*//;s/[[:blank:]]*$//' input.txt
```

This command will trim the file `input.txt` and overwrite it with the trimmed version.
