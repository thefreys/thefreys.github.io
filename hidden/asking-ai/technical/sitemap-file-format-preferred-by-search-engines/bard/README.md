**1. XML Sitemaps:**

- **Format:** XML (Extensible Markup Language) file that lists URLs along with optional metadata like:
    - Last modification date
    - Change frequency
    - Priority
- **Maximum size:** 50MB (uncompressed) or 50,000 URLs
- **Advantages:**
    - Versatile, supporting various content types
    - Can provide rich metadata
    - Extensible to accommodate specific needs

**2. Text Sitemaps (Rarely Used):**

- **Supported by:** Google, Bing, Yahoo (as a secondary option)
- **Format:** Plain text file with one URL per line
- **Maximum size:** 50,000 URLs
- **Advantages:**
    - Simple to create
    - May be suitable for smaller websites

**General Best Practices:**

- **UTF-8 encoding:** Ensure your sitemap files are encoded in UTF-8 for compatibility.
- **Sitemap index files:** Use these to organize large sitemaps or multiple sitemaps, each with a maximum of 50,000 URLs.
- **Compression:** Compress sitemap files using gzip to reduce file size and speed up transfers.
- **Submission:** Submit sitemaps to search engines through their respective webmaster tools or by adding a `<loc>` tag to your robots.txt file.
- **Regular updates:** Keep sitemaps updated as your website content changes.
