# Finding new recipes

## Traditional Search

I used to get recipes by performing a google search or using sites like allrecipes.  Unfortunately, I'd end up forgetting where I got a recipe we liked and I'd have a hard time finding it again. I've also been burned by terrible recipes where 1 or 2 ingredients were listed with a bad quantity.  To combat this, I would compare a few from different sources and look to see what they had in common. This became tedious and time consuming - especially with all the back stories interspersed throughout the recipe.

## Using AI

In 2023, I stated asking ChatGPT for recipes.  Today, I ask 3 AIs (ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing) for the same recipe, save them here, and eventually I'll try them. If one (or a combination/modification of the three) turns out how we like, it will officially be added to the other folders in this recipe area.

### How do AIs write recipes?

Well, I asked them! ChatGPT and Bard gave great responses with detail. Bing, not so much. Below is what they said on January 20, 2024:

When writing recipes, GPT-4 follows a structured approach similar to how a chef or a cookbook author might create a recipe. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Identification of the Dish**: First, GPT-4 identifies the type of dish being requested or the key ingredients to be included. This could be anything from a specific cuisine like Italian or Thai, to a type of meal like a dessert or a vegan dish.

2. **Selection of Ingredients**: Based on the dish, GPT-4 lists the necessary ingredients. It considers factors like the dish's origin, traditional ingredients, common substitutions, and dietary considerations. The ingredients are usually listed in the order they'll be used.

3. **Quantities and Measurements**: Accurate measurements for each ingredient are provided. This includes specifying teaspoons, tablespoons, cups, ounces, or grams, depending on the ingredient and the culinary tradition of the dish.

4. **Step-by-Step Instructions**: GPT-4 outlines the steps required to prepare the dish. This includes the method of preparation (e.g., chopping, boiling, baking), the order of combining ingredients, cooking times, and temperatures. The instructions aim to be clear and easy to follow, suitable for the intended audience, whether they're beginners or experienced cooks.

5. **Cooking Tips and Variations**: Often, GPT-4 may include additional tips for preparing the dish, such as how to tell when it's properly cooked, or suggestions for ingredient substitutions. It may also offer variations on the recipe to accommodate different tastes or dietary needs.

6. **Presentation and Serving Suggestions**: Sometimes, GPT-4 includes advice on how to present the dish and what to serve it with. This could range from garnish suggestions to pairing it with side dishes or drinks.

7. **Nutritional Information (if applicable)**: In some cases, GPT-4 might provide basic nutritional information, such as calorie count, or highlight if the dish meets certain dietary requirements, like being high in protein or low in carbs.

It's important to note that while GPT-4 can generate recipes based on a vast database of culinary knowledge, it doesn't create recipes from personal experience or taste testing. Therefore, while the recipes generated are usually sound in terms of culinary principles, users might need to adjust them based on personal taste, ingredient availability, or specific dietary needs.

### Bard said:

When you ask me for a recipe, I access my knowledge of ingredients, cooking techniques, and popular dishes from a variety of sources, including:

* **Massive recipe databases:** I have access to countless recipes from established chefs, food blogs, and home cooks. This allows me to draw inspiration from different styles and adapt them to your preferences.
* **Dietary and allergy information:** I can tailor recipes to specific dietary needs or allergies by searching for options that omit certain ingredients or use substitutes.
* **User preferences:** If you mention any specific ingredients you have on hand or flavors you enjoy, I can prioritize recipes that align with your interests.
* **Cooking knowledge:** I understand the science and techniques behind cooking, so I can ensure the recipe is clear, concise, and provides the right steps for preparing the dish successfully.

Here's a breakdown of how I actually generate a recipe for you:

1. **Identify your request:** I begin by analyzing your question or prompt to understand what type of recipe you're looking for. Are you seeking a classic dish, a healthier option, something for a specific occasion, or using particular ingredients?
2. **Search and filter:** I then delve into my vast database of recipes, filtering them based on your criteria. This might involve keywords, dietary restrictions, cooking times, or even cuisines.
3. **Combine and adapt:** I don't just copy and paste a single recipe. I might blend elements from several recipes, adjusting ingredient quantities, cooking methods, or adding my own creative twist based on my understanding of food science and flavor profiles.
4. **Present clearly:** The final step is to format the recipe in a way that's easy to understand and follow. This includes providing clear instructions, precise measurements, and helpful tips for successful execution.

Ultimately, my goal is to provide you with a delicious and satisfying recipe that aligns with your specific needs and preferences. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, I'm always happy to hear them!

I hope this explanation gives you a better understanding of how I use my knowledge and abilities to write recipes for you. Feel free to ask me for any recipe you'd like, and I'll do my best to create something wonderful for you to enjoy!

Bing Chat can help you write recipes in a few ways. One way is to use the **Compose** feature in Microsoft Edge. Compose is an AI-powered content writer that can help you create drafts in tones like Professional, Funny, Enthusiastic, and more, so you can write with ease and confidence. You can access Compose by clicking the Bing Chat icon in the upper-right of the Edge toolbar, and then clicking Compose at the top of the sidepane. Compose is available in the same languages as Bing Chat. Simply start typing in your preferred language in the Write about box. To learn more about supported languages, go to Bing.com/new ยน. 

Another way is to use the **AI Prompt Writing** feature in Bing Chat. You can prompt Bing Chat to write a recipe by clearly outlining the task or information you need from Bing Chat. For example, you could say "I'm looking for a simple pasta recipe using ingredients I have at home. Can you suggest a tomato-based pasta dish?" โด. 

I hope this helps!
