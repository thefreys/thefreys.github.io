# Representing a family tree in a web page

While working on the visual representation of the Sitemap this morning, I wondered if CSS and Javascript could flip an HTML list containing nested lists to display like a family tree. I had to ask AI, of course.

This is what I asked: 

> I have a family tree represented using nested lists where the root ul is me and the 2 li items are my parents, each with their own nested ol for their parents and so on.  How can I make that display like a tree on my web page?
