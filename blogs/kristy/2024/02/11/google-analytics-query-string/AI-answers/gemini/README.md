There are two main approaches to track each value of a query string parameter as a different page in Google Analytics:

**1. Using Custom Dimensions:**

* **Extract the parameter value:** Use Google Tag Manager (GTM) to create a custom variable that extracts the value of the query string parameter you want to track.
* **Set a custom dimension:** Configure your GTM tag to set a custom dimension with the extracted value. This dimension acts as a new category for page views.
* **Analyze data:** In Google Analytics, create custom reports to analyze data based on the newly created custom dimension. You can see how users interact with different values of the query string parameter.

**2. Using URL Rewrite Rules:**

* **Configure server-side rewrite:** Set up rewrite rules on your web server to rewrite URLs with different query string parameter values to unique virtual pages. This creates separate entries in Google Analytics for each value.
* **Track virtual pages:** Configure your analytics tracking code to capture virtual pageviews for the rewritten URLs.
* **Analyze data:** Analyze data in Google Analytics using the "All Pages" report, filtering by the rewritten URLs to see how users interact with different parameter values.

**Important considerations:**

* **Implementation complexity:** Using custom dimensions is generally easier to implement, while URL rewrite rules require more technical expertise.
* **Data sampling:** With many unique values, custom dimensions might hit sampling limits. URL rewrite rules avoid this but can create many virtual pages.
* **Data granularity:** Custom dimensions offer more granular data (individual parameter values), while URL rewrite rules group data by broader categories.

**Additional tips:**

* **Choose meaningful parameter names:** Select query string parameters that provide valuable insights into user behavior.
* **Limit the number of tracked parameters:** Avoid tracking too many parameters to prevent data overload and maintain clarity.
* **Test and validate:** Thoroughly test your implementation to ensure accurate data capture before relying on the results.

By following these approaches and considering the trade-offs, you can effectively track how users interact with different values of your query string parameters in Google Analytics, gaining valuable insights into their behavior and preferences.
